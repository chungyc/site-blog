There's bad news for clean energy industries.  The House and the Senate have <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/biz/6026122.html">approved conflicting versions of an energy bill</a> that is intended to spur development of alternate energy sources.  The energy bill <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2008/09/26/house_delays_vote_on_tax_measure/">includes badly needed tax credits</a> for solar energy and energy efficiency measures.  If Congress can't sort things in time, it will be a blow to the clean energy industries which need to be developed sufficiently before it's too late.  If we delay things until the need for clean energy becomes crystal clear, then it might already be too late and we might not have sufficient resources to develop new energy sources.

Considering the huge subsidies that the fossil fuel industry receives, it's odd to see opposition to the subsidy of alternative energy justified by claiming that the free market should take care of it.  Especially since it's the alternative energy sources that needs a boost to prepare for the decline in oil production and mitigate climate change.
