Vice President Dick Cheney went all the way to Georgia to support the country and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7597336.stm">condemn Russia for violating its borders</a>.  Amazingly enough, I actually agree with him.  Russia might have been justified in counter-attacking Georgian forces in the beginning, but they have reacted far more aggressively than what would be expected for peacekeepers.  In fact, their giving away Russian passports to South Ossetians long before the conflict and the way they invaded the region with overwhelming force makes it pretty clear that they're not trying to support a people's autonomy; they want to take Georgia's territory for their own.

It's just too bad that America's preemptive invasion of Iraq based on false premises undercuts any condemnation of Russia the US government makes.  Even when the Bush administration is doing something right, they had already sabotaged their own good doings long ago.
