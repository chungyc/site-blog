A <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/263/report_display.asp">survey</a> by the Pew Research center indicates that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080917-the-kids-are-all-right-gamers-well-adjusted-civic-minded.html">video gaming is not the totally negative influence</a> some people believe it to be, at least for teenagers.  I've believed this all along, considering gaming to be just like any other recreational activity, but it's nice to see the belief being backed up by actual research.  Surprisingly, gamers apparently are more politically active than non-gamers.

No doubt we will still hear the oft-cited admonition that someone is too old to play computer games, but at least I can point to this survey when someone starts citing the "evils" of gaming.
