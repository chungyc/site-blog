To get another look at what I've been talking about, I've used <a href="http://wordle.net/">Wordle</a> yet again to generate a word cloud for this blog.  Compared to the <a href="http://blog.chungyc.org/2008/07/scribbled-word-cloud/">last time</a> I did so, it seems I've been a bit more balanced about what I've been blogging.  I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing.
