Despite the FBI offering to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/16/washington/16anthrax.html">release
their evidence against Dr. Ivins</a>, their case against him in the
anthrax case still seems to be
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/washington/07anthrax.html">rather
flimsy</a>.  At least to me, it seems that their entire case is based
on him being eccentric and that he had access to the strain of anthrax
used in the attacks.

He may or may not have been responsible, but I find it hard to
conclude that Dr. Ivins was responsible.  I know a lot of people who
are as comparably eccentric (I'd say that would include me, and I
can't conceive myself of hurting someone else).  And with a hundred
people also having had access to the same strain, the FBI hardly has a
slam-dunk case.  Even though there are plenty of cases where a
hypothesis is strongly supported only in the context of the
accumulated evidence, this doesn't look like one of them, despite
claims to the contrary by the FBI.

Is there some public information that I'm missing?  Maybe I missed a
press release by the FBI that presents a strong case.  Or is the FBI
desperate to close the case only for political reasons?  At least the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/science/21anthrax.html">science</a>
behind their claim that the strain of anthrax used in the attacks came
from Fort Detrick sounds fascinating, although I don't have the
competence to judge how strong it is.
