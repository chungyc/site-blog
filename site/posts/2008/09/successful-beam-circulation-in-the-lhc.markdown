The Large Hadron Collider has just successfully <a href="http://twitter.com/lhc_firstbeam/statuses/916153586">completed its first beam circulation</a> through the collider, with the beam reaching all the way to the huge <a href="http://atlas.ch/">ATLAS detector</a>.  This is a great moment for physics, and I wish their path to even greater moments goes just as well, from the first head-one beam collisions to ramping up the collider to full energy.

<strong>Update</strong>: First ATLAS event display from a <a href="http://twitter.com/lhc_firstbeam/statuses/916170201">tweet</a>:
