Canadian astronomers have used the <a href="http://www.gemini.edu/">Gemini North telescope</a> at Hawaii to obtain what may be the first <a href="http://www.gemini.edu/sunstarplanet">image of a planet orbiting another star</a> similar to our own Sun.  The spectrum from the light of the supposed planet indicates that it is too young and too small to be a small star, so they believe that it is indeed a planet.

However, they will still need to use more traditional techniques that measure the effect of the planet on its parent star, such as wobbling due to the mutual gravitational pulls or a tiny reduction of starlight as the planet passes in front of the star, to confirm that it is really a planet and not a small star that just happens to look like it's nearby.  This could take a couple of years.
