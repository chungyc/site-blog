Canadian astronomers have used the
<a href="https://www.gemini.edu/">Gemini North telescope</a> at Hawaii to
obtain what may be the first
<a href="https://www.gemini.edu/sunstarplanet">image of a planet orbiting
another star</a> similar to our own Sun.  The spectrum from the light
of the supposed planet indicates that it is too young and too small to
be a small star, so they believe that it is indeed a planet.

However, they will still need to use more traditional techniques that
measure the effect of the planet on its parent star, such as wobbling
due to the mutual gravitational pulls or a tiny reduction of starlight
as the planet passes in front of the star, to confirm that it is
really a planet and not a small star that just happens to look like
it's nearby.  This could take a couple of years.
