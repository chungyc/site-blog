I will be migrating Stochastic Scribbles to a self-managed WordPress
installation, so in the meantime I will be turning off all comments in
this blog.  And don't worry if no posts are made for a while; I'll be
spending all of my free time in moving the blog.  You'll know when the
move is complete when the blog suddenly looks different and comments
can be made again.
