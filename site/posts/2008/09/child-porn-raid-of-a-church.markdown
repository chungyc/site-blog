Why is it that it's always extremely fundamentalist religious sects which tend to favor polygamy with young girls?  I thought it was supposed to the <em>other</em> way around, with godless gay marriage opening the door to polygamy and perverse sexual deviants.  In yet another example of "upstanding Christian morality", another church has been <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iM_k_Z5_nC3gb0btse0fgEAFl4RAD93B4UOO0">raided for alleged child abuse and pornography</a>.

I've sort of come to expect child abuse from extremist religious sects from stories about Christians and Muslims, but the accusations of pornography are rather a surprise.  Maybe the pornography charges are mistaken, and it's just another case of some people still thinking that children and woman are property instead of being individuals in their own right.  Considering how many religious people are so adamantly against gay marriage despite repeated clarifications that it's between two <em>consenting</em> individuals, I also have a sneaky suspicion that they lack an understanding of what "consent" means.  It could explain why certain religious sects consider it just fine to indoctrinate children and marry them against their will, while being completely unable to wrap their minds around the marriage of two consenting adults.

Or it may turn out that the church really is producing child pornography.  This would be a depressing case of a manipulative religious leader cynically exploiting his flock.  Or maybe it's just due to an attempt to "record a sacred matrimonial union for posterity".  Nonetheless, the absence of a concrete basis for religion kind of makes it hard for anyone to explain religiously why such things are wrong, which may be why these things happen much more often in an organized manner with religions.

The best case would be that this is all a huge misunderstanding and that no child abuse occurred.  Sadly, history indicates that the chances for this aren't so good.
