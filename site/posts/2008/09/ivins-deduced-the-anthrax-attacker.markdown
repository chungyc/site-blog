In a bizarre twist in the anthrax case, Dr. Ivins seemed to have thought that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/washington/AP-Anthrax-Investigation.html">he figured out who the culprit was</a> in the anthrax attacks of 2001.  From what I hear about him, he seemed to be an Internet troll and an eccentric, but this hardly makes a compelling case for Dr. Ivins being the perpetuator.  And it's even harder to think so given that he emailed himself about figuring out who the actual perpetuator was.

It's odd that he failed to tell anyone about his suspicions, though.  On the other hand, he may have indeed told the authorities and was harassed for it.  Perhaps he was silenced and his death set up to look like a suicide to hide a conspiracy in the government.  I've always thought that the FBI was scapegoating Dr. Ivins to avoid the political embarrassment of being unable to solve the case, but this new twist gives a little bit of credence to conspiracy theories that the anthrax attacks were orchestrated by the government.
