Remember the uproar over <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/its_a_goddamned_cracker.php">Crackergate</a>?  Webster Cook, the student who was harassed and received death threats for taking a piece of bread out of a church, has been <a href="http://theedger.org/2008/08/30/webster-cook-impeached-without-due-process/">impeached from his position in the university senate</a>.  What's galling is that the impeachment proceedings against him seems to have been corrupted so that he could neither defend himself nor were the testimony against him verified.

I don't know if it was religiously motivated or whether it was pure dirty politics, but it's corruption nonetheless.  They went to all this trouble to impeach someone for taking a piece of food; somehow I doubt they're going to try anything against the people who made death threats against Webster Cook, something infinitely more serious.
