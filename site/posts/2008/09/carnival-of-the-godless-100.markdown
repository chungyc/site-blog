The 100th edition of the Carnival of the Godless is up at <a href="http://priorperceptions.com/2008/09/13/carnival-of-the-godless-100/">Prior Perceptions</a>.  It's a blog carnival with lots of links to various blog posts related to atheism and agnosticism, and this edition also includes my <a href="/2008/09/being-moral-is-in-the-eyes-of-the-beholder/">musings</a> on moral relativism.
