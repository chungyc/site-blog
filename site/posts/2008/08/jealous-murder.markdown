It's looking more like the <a href="http://blog.chungyc.org/2008/08/murders-in-beijing-olympics.html">knife attack on Americans in Beijing</a> soon after the start of the Olympics has little to do with the victims being foreigners and everything to do with them being a happy family.  It appears that Tang Yongming attacked them because he had severe family problems, and seeing a happy family with two parents and their daughter may have triggered a rage that made him attack.  Or perhaps he was planning to attack any happy-looking family from the start: it would explain why he was carrying a knife.  If this speculation is true, then the timing of the attack coming soon after the start of the Olympics may simply be a coincidence.

While the attack is still inexcusable and does not lessen the tragedy the family has suffered, it would at least indicate that there shouldn't be a repeat of the attack.  The good news is that the <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ilmqox3TlPglISoPZaTE7UR7t_xgD92FTAA00">condition of the wife is improving</a>, so hopefully there will be only one murder victim, which is bad enough.
