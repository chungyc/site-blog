<p>
While I may have been ho-hum about an <a href="/2008/08/overexcited-about-beam-circulation.html">announcement of the schedule</a> for beam circulation in the Large Hadron Collider, I'm a bit more excited about the <a href="http://uslhc.us/blogs/?p=301">first beam being successfully injected into the collider</a>.  Guess I'm more excited about actual events rather than plans for events.
