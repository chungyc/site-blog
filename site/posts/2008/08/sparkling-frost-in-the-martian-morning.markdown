<p>
Frost has formed not just <a href="/2008/08/frost-on-mars.html">on the ground</a> around the Mars Phoenix Lander, it has also <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/phoenix/images.php?fileID=15714">formed on the telltale mirror</a> it uses to measure how the wind is blowing.  What's more, they also had the lander send a sequence of images so we can actually see how the mirror sparkles in the sun as water frost accumulates throughout the morning.
