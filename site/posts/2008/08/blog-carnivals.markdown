<p>
Blogs are a great way to see what other people think and talk with each other.  However, a single blog only includes what its writers express, so you could miss the chance to read great stuff in other blogs if you simply follow a fixed set of blogs.  <a href="http://blogcarnival.com/">Blog carnivals</a> overcome this by linking to multiple blog posts in a certain topic, so you can expose yourself to great content in blogs you've never been to before.

I've seen interesting content via blog carnivals, and I've also participated in a few myself:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.computernewbie.info/wheatdogg/2008/06/25/the-tangled-bank-108/">The Tangled Bank #108</a>, where I talked about <a href="/2008/06/building-space-time.html">causal dynamical triangulations</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nautblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/carnival-of-godless-96.html">Carnival of the Godless #96</a>, where I talked about how unconvincing <a href="/2008/07/god-of-gaps.html">arguments from incredulity</a> for the existence of a god is</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cultofgracie.com/2008/07/carnival-of-liberals.html">Carnival of Liberals</a>, where I talked about how even a <a href="/2008/07/terrorism-in-police-state.html">police state cannot stop terrorism</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.rantsnreviews.com/2008/07/rants-july-30-2008.html">Rants carnival</a>, where I rant about <a href="/2008/07/north-korea-murdered-tourist.html">North Korea killing a tourist</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kieranbennett.com/2008/08/03/carnival-of-the-godless-97/">Carnival of the Godless #97</a>, where I suggest a way to <a href="http://blog.chungyc.org/2008/07/solution-to-crackergate.html">placate the Catholics</a>
</ul>

<p>
If you like reading blog posts in certain fields but can't dare to follow every single blog in the world which talks about the subject, then chances are that there is a blog carnival you could be interested in.  And if you write something great on your own blog, you might want to consider expanding your readership by submitting the post to a blog carnival.
