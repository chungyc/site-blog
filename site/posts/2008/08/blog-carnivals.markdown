Blogs are a great way to see what other people think and talk with each other.  However, a
single blog only includes what its writers express, so you could miss the chance to read
great stuff in other blogs if you simply follow a fixed set of blogs.  Blog carnivals
overcome this by linking to multiple blog posts in a certain topic, so you can expose
yourself to great content in blogs you've never been to before.

I've seen interesting content via blog carnivals, and I've also participated in a few myself:

<ul>
<li>The Tangled Bank #108, where I talked about <a href="/2008/06/building-space-time/">causal dynamical triangulations</a></li>
<li>Carnival of the Godless #96, where I talked about how unconvincing <a href="/2008/07/god-of-the-gaps/">arguments from incredulity</a> for the existence of a god is</li>
<li>Carnival of Liberals, where I had talked about how even a police state cannot stop terrorism</li>
<li>Rants carnival, where I had ranted about North Korea killing a tourist</li>
<li>Carnival of the Godless #97, where I had suggested a way to placate the Catholics</li>
</ul>

If you like reading blog posts in certain fields but can't dare to follow every single blog in the world which talks about the subject, then chances are that there is a blog carnival you could be interested in.  And if you write something great on your own blog, you might want to consider expanding your readership by submitting the post to a blog carnival.
