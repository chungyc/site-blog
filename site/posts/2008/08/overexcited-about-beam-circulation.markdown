A lot of science web sites seem to be excited about plans for the <a href="http://uslhc.us/blogs/?p=296">initial beam circulation</a> in the Large Hadron Collider on September 10.  While it's a great step into getting the particle accelerator online, I'm a bit less excited about it than others.  Personally, I'm waiting for the start of actual collisions between opposing beams a month or two later, which is when we'll start to get some <em>real</em> scientific data.

I wonder if this makes me a dour wet blanket?
