<p>
The <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/08/tangled_bank.php">Tangled Bank #111</a> is up on the <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/">denialism blog</a>.  It's a blog carnival for anything sciency, especially for life science stuff.  This issue introduces everything with poetry, which is wasted on me but I suspect is cool for most people.  It also links to my <a href="/2008/07/is-fine-tuning-really-fine-tuning.html">rant on fine-tuning</a>.
