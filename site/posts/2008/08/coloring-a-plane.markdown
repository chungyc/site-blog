[Skeptic's Play] has a couple of interesting geometry puzzles I've repeated below:

1.  Let's say I've painted a plane â€” the flat kind, not the flying kind.
    Every single point on the plane is assigned the color <span style="color:red;">red</span>
    or <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>.
    Prove that there must exist two points of the same color that are exactly one unit apart.

2.  Every single point on the plane is assigned the color <span style="color:red;">red</span>,
    <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>, or <span style="color:green;">green</span>.
    Prove that there must exist two points of the same color that are exactly one unit apart.

What makes this interesting is that you can't assume anything about how a plane could be
painted.  Mathematically, there can be all sorts of ways one could color a plane that are
literally unimaginable.  For example, if you color all points with rational number
Cartesian coordinates with red, then the entire plane is colored red and yet it is at the
same time almost completely colorless.  [Fractals] are another example, where you can
imagine large scale structures, but it's not really possible to imagine it with all the
small scale structures repeating no matter how much you zoom in.  To prove the above
statements, one needs to use a method that would still apply no matter how bizarrely the
plane is colored.

Anyways, the first statement is pretty easy to prove.
Let's assume that there are no two points that are one unit apart that have the same color.
Then there are <em>both</em> <span style="color:red;">red</span>
and <span style="color:blue;">blue</span> points in the plane.
If there was only one color
, then any two points at unit distance would obviously be the same color.
Let's pick any <span style="color:blue;">blue</span> point.
Then the circle centered around the <span style="color:blue;">blue</span> point
with a unit radius must be completely <span style="color:red;">red</span>.
Any two points on the circle that are a unit distance apart would both
be <span style="color:red;">red</span>, which would be a contradiction.

That was easy, but would the second statement be as easy to solve?
Let's try to repeat our approach and assume that
no two points a unit distance apart has the same color.
Without loss of generality, let's pick any point A and say
that it's <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>.
Then the unit circle centered around A must be made of points that are
either <span style="color:red;">red</span> or <span style="color:green;">green</span>.
Again without loss of generality, let's pick any point B on the circle
and say that it's <span style="color:green;">green</span>.
Then the unit circle around B must be <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>
or <span style="color:red;">red</span>.
Then point C at where the two circles intersect must be <span style="color:red;">red</span>.
And the unit circle around C must be <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>
or <span style="color:green;">green</span>.
I show this in the figure below, where a <span style="color:magenta;">magenta</span> circle
is made up of points that can be either <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>
or <span style="color:red;">red</span>,
a <span style="color:yellow;">yellow</span> circle is made up of points
that can be either <span style="color:red;">red</span> or <span style="color:green;">green</span>,
and a <span style="color:cyan;">cyan</span> circle is made up of points
that can be either <span style="color:blue;">blue</span> or <span style="color:green;">green</span>.

![Geometry proof step one for three colors](geometry-proof-step-1-for-three-colors.png)

The obvious path to take is to repeatedly draw a circle around each intersection
and hope there is a point which must result in a contradictory coloring.
This would happen if <span style="color:magenta;">magenta</span>,
<span style="color:yellow;">yellow</span>, and <span style="color:cyan;">cyan</span>
circles all intersected at a single point.
Unfortunately, this never happens no matter how far you go.
In fact, we get a repeating pattern for the intersections that
is consistent with our initial assumption.  We need another approach.

![Dead end strategy for painting three colors](painting-three-colors-with-a-dead-end-path.png)

Instead of trying to find two intersections from circles 
that are centered around existing intersections,
we'll try making a unit circle that isn't centered around a pre-existing intersection.
First we do what we did before until we get point D below.
Then we move around a unit circle that passes through point D and the arc between A and A' below.
This unit circle must be centered around a point O on
the <span style="color:magenta;">magenta</span> circle centered on D.
We want to change L by moving point O and its circle around until it's equal to the unit distance.
This is possible since the smallest value for L is zero and the largest value
is the square root of three or about 1.73, which is the distance between A and A'.

![First working step to painting three colors](painting-three-colors-with-working-step-1.png)

Once we move point O so that L becomes the unit distance as in below,
we finally get our contradiction.
Without loss of generality, assume that point O is colored red.
Then points E and F, both being the intersection of
the <span style="color:magenta;">magenta</span> and <span style="color:cyan;">cyan</span> circles,
must both be <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>.
Since points E and F are a unit distance apart,
this contradicts our initial assumption that no two points a unit distance apart are the same color.

This was a fun but frustrating puzzle to solve.
Proving the first statement was really easy,
but I got trapped in the dead-end approach for too long for the second statement.
The ease of the first one kept me working on the second one
since I thought it should also have a trivial solution.
Unfortunately, I kept working with variations of the dead-end approach
hoping to get an intersection with contradictory colorings,
and it even reached the point that I wondered if there _was_ a way
to color a plane so that no two points a unit distance apart were the same color.
But a slight detour in the approach helped me reach a simple solution,
so I can now stop worrying about the puzzle.

It was a nice way to exercise my brain and prove that it hasn't completely ossified yet.
However, when the <a href="http://skepticsplay.blogspot.com/">Skeptic's Play</a>
gives its next puzzle, I should be wary of deceptively easy looking puzzles like this one,
where the first half was so simple that it made me think the second half should also be as trivial.
It should at least help prevent me from underestimating how much time I need to waste ...
