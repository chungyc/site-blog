<p>
The good news about the conflict between Russia and Georgia is that it seems to have subsided, although <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7579324.stm">Russia is still dragging its feet</a>.  It's a relief to know that fears of a third world war were overblown, not that many people besides myself <a href="/2008/08/russia-and-georgia-almost-at-war.html">worried about it</a>.
</p>

<p>
One outcome of the conflict is that <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nation/5961259.html">Georgia ended up looking much better than Russia</a> in the foreign media.  Despite Georgia having attacked the separatist region of South Ossetia, Russia didn't help its image by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/world/europe/10gori.html">raining down as much or even more destruction</a> on the region and invading non-separatist regions of Georgia.
</p>

<p>
Their image also isn't at all helped by the fact that they're trying to prevent Georgia from doing what they already did with Chechnya, and the fact that they used unsubstantiated and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-fg-breakaway18-2008aug18,0,5306223.story">apparently false claims of genocide</a> as an excuse even as <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/23/europe/EU-Georgia-Russia-Looting.php">South Ossetians loot other Georgians</a>.  And they're doing a rather miserable job of making themselves not look like a nation with imperial ambitions, with the way they <a href="http://businessneweurope.eu/story1211">gave out Russian passports to South Ossetians</a> and then claiming that they're invading to protect their citizens.
</p>

<p>
While there have been faults on both sides, although it may be unclear which side is "more" wrong, Russia clearly needs a better handle on diplomacy and foreign public relations.
