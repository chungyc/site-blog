According to the San Francisco Chronicle, China has confiscated more than 300 Bibles from American Christians that arrived at Kunming Airport.  While the title "<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/08/17/international/i071729D87.DTL">China confiscates Bibles from American Christians</a>" initially outraged me, thinking that the Chinese government had confiscated personal copies of the Bible (despite what some people might think of atheists, I'm a big believer in freedom of <em>and</em> from religion), it turns out that the Christians brought along a boatload of Bibles to use for proselytizing.  This considerably weakens the sympathy I have for the Christians.

Still, I'm unhappy with the way China suppresses religion, where they do things like confiscating Bibles.  (I'm not outraged, since it's the kind of thing I've come to expect from them.)  While I would like to see more atheists among the populace, I want this to be because they reasoned it out and rejected extraordinary claims with little to no evidence.  Incidentally, I'd also like to see more skeptics for the same reason.  I absolutely abhor the use of force to coerce people to abandon beliefs; this would just be replacing one arbitrary authority with another arbitrary authority.

For that matter, I don't like all of the censorship that China enforces.  People shouldn't have to continuously worry whether what they think or say will be suppressed by the state.  They should be able to freely think wherever their thoughts take them.  The fact that the Chinese government feels the need for an oppressive degree of censorship might be an indication of what they think of their own system of government.
