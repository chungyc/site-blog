North Korea is yet again <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/world/asia/27korea.html">balking at dismantling its nuclear program</a>.  Given the constant hostile threats the country makes and the way they <a href="/2008/07/north-korea-murdered-tourist.html">marginalize human life</a>, they're really trying hard to make people think that they don't deserve <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/homepageCrisis/idUSSP236079._CH_.2400">humanitarian aid</a>.  It almost makes me wish that all aid is halted so that the current North Korean government could collapse the way their incompetence deserves.

On the other hand, withholding aid could result in thousands or even millions starving to death, so I can't quite be vocal about halting humanitarian aid to North Korea.  And of course, there's the specter of war if things get too bad in the country.  It's a messy dilemma they're putting the rest of the world in.
