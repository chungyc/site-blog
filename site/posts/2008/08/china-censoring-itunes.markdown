China is <a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/apple-itunes-store-is-blocked-in-china-internet-users-say/">blocking access to the iTunes Store</a>,
apparently because of the sale of pro-Tibet songs.
I wonder if my own blog is censored in China?
Most probably not despite my great dislike for several of China's policies,
but it would be cool if it were:
it would be an honor to be considered politically important enough to censor.

I wonder if there is a public list of blogs that are blocked in China?
They might be good ones to subscribe to ...
