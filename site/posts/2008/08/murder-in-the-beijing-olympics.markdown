<p>
It has been less than a day since the Beijing Olympics has started, but there is already a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/09/olympics.murder/">murder of an American</a> in the city.  Was this just an attack by a deranged man?  Or was it a politically motivated terrorist attack expressing anti-American sentiments?  It might not be easy to figure out his motivations given that the murderer killed himself.
