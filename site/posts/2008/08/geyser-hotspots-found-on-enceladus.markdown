This is a pretty exciting week for space exploration.  While the Phoenix lander managed to image a single particle of Martian dust <a href="/2008/08/microscopic-view-of-martian-dust.html">with its atomic force microscope</a> and Hubble had orbited Earth more than <a href="/2008/08/happy-100000th-birthday-hubble.html">100,000 times</a>, Cassini made a very <a href="/2008/08/enceladus-flyby.html">close flyby of Enceladus</a>, a moon of Saturn.
</p>

<p>
And one of the results from the Enceladus flyby is that Cassini managed to <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-160">pinpoint the source of the incredible water geysers of Enceladus</a>.  They're deep cracks on the surface of the moon with icy debris all round them.  I wonder what it would have looked like at ground zero when the geysers erupted?
