The <a href="http://www.ptank.com/catsynth/index.php?entry=entry080808-191306">38th Carnival of Mathematics</a> is up at <a href="http://www.ptank.com/catsynth/">CatSynth</a>.  It links to various blog posts around the Web that talk about math, from opinions about why we learn math to technical exposÃ©s of specialized topics.  It also links to my <a href="/2008/08/coloring-plane.html">discussion</a> of solving a puzzle from <a href="http://skepticsplay.blogspot.com/2008/08/painted-plane.html">Skeptic's Play</a>.
