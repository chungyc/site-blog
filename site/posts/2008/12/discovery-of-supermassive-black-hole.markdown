I don't get it.  Why do so many news outlets such as the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7774287.stm">BBC</a> talk as if there had been any uncertainty in the existence of a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy?  We already had direct evidence of its existence by <a href="http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2002/pr-17-02.html">observing how stars rapidly swing by it</a> in their orbit around the center of the galaxy for years.

While the recent observations and corroboration are exciting in their own right, as it refines previous measurements and make things even more certain, I don't understand the slant a lot of the news media has been putting on the news.  Am I missing something?
