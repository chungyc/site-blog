One interesting chemical instrument has been installed on the International Space Station.
Called <a
href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081211081805.htm">Space-DRUMS</a>, it
is a chemical reactor which can prevent the reacting chemicals from contacting any other
solid material by suspending them in mid-air using sound waves.  This means that it can
avoid any chemical contamination from a container, such as plastics or glass, which can be
useful for manufacturing ultra-pure chemical products.  Although it might not be so useful
if you even have to worry about contamination from the air itself: vacuum could prevent
contamination from air, but then there wouldn't be any sound waves to contain chemical
reactions.

This is the sort of thing that would be very difficult to do on the ground, if feasible at
all.  I have a feeling that sound waves powerful enough to suspend chemicals in mid-air in
one Earth gravity would disrupt many chemical reactions that people may want to try ...
