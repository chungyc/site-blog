One interesting chemical instrument has been installed on the International Space Station.  Called <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081211081805.htm">Space-DRUMS</a>, it is a chemical reactor which can prevent the reacting chemicals from contacting any other solid material by suspending them in mid-air using sound waves.  This means that it can avoid any chemical contamination from a container, such as plastics or glass, which can be useful for manufacturing ultra-pure chemical products.  Although it might not be so useful if you even have to worry about contamination from the air itself: vacuum could prevent contamination from air, but then there wouldn't be any sound waves to contain chemical reactions.

This is the sort of thing that would be very difficult to do on the ground, if feasible at all.  I have a feeling that sound waves powerful enough to suspend chemicals in mid-air in one Earth gravity would disrupt many chemical reactions that people may want to try ...
