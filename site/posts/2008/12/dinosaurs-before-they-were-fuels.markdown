It is the rare boy who hasn't been in love with dinosaurs.  I still have a fondness for dinosaurs, but I haven't been keeping up with the news, given how much is coming out concerning dinosaurs from their over a hundred millions of years of existence.  So I find the video podcast <a href="http://finitecomedy.com/dinosaurs"><cite>Dinosaurs: Before They Were Fuels</cite></a> to be a nice way to hear about dinosaurs.  It's a light-hearted and light-weight way to keep up with current news about dinosaurs, which is a good thing considering all of the other stuff that gobbles up my time.
