To those few who still think that the average Iraqi believes that the invasion by the United States has been a positive, the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article5346089.ece">recent shoe throwing at President Bush</a> by an Iraqi journalist and the large public support for him should be a vivid indicator that they may be wrong.  In fact, I think President Bush actually deserves it with how terrible he has been in everything, not just because of the invasion of Iraq.  That's just how bad I think he has been for the past eight years.

American journalists should have been more like the Iraqi journalist in question, throwing "shoes" at the president in the form of tough questions, especially in the early years.  On the other hand, it's rather ironic how it's easier for a dissenting foreigner to get close enough to President Bush to throw an actual shoe, compared to how hard it is for dissenting <em>Americans</em> to get close enough to even just show him dissenting <em>words</em>.
