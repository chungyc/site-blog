Using a giant radio telescope in Germany, <a
href="https://www.nrao.edu/pr/2008/farwater/">water molecules have been detected</a> in a
galaxy about 11 billion light-years away.  This means that there was already detectable
amounts of water in our universe when it was only less than four billion years old, which
also means that there must have already been enough supernovas by then to create plenty of
oxygen.

Like many other cosmological objects from the far past, the detection was aided thanks to
the gravitational lensing provided by a foreground galaxy.  Detection was also aided by
the fact that the water effectively acted as a gigantic <em>laser</em> powered by the
supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy, except that radio waves are emitted
instead of visible light.
