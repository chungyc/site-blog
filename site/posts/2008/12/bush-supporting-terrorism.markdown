This is a crazy paranoid conspiracy theory, but why is it that so much of what the Bush administration has done over the past eight years seems to have been geared towards <em>increasing</em> terrorism?  The administration might not have directly supported terrorists, but it is a widespread opinion that the Iraq War and the way they condoned torture has been a great motivation and recruitment drive for terrorism.  And now with the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE4BD01R20081214">bombing of a bank in Oregon</a> that killed two people, it occurs to me that the current economic meltdown might not just be the result of the Bush administration's incompetence and wishful thinking.  For some reason, I wonder if it was deliberate so that people would have more reasons to commit terrorism.

Perhaps it is all a deliberate plan to somehow rule the world by taking advantage of terrorism.  By doing so much on the international stage to turn around international sympathy after the 9/11 attacks into universal anti-American sentiment, the Bush administration has been pretty successful at motivating terrorism abroad.  And not only by blatant disregard for the constitution, which Bush once called <a href="http://www.infowars.net/articles/december2005/121205neocons.htm">"just a goddamned piece of paper"</a>, but also by destroying the economy, the Bush administration may have done its best to spark domestic terrorism.  Why else would a bank be bombed at a time like this?  The timing suggests that it may have been motivated not only by the economic crisis, but also due to anger over bailing out financial institutions while so many resist bailing out industries that support the average workers.

Of course, it may just as well be that this is all a paranoid fantasy, and that the bank bombing was just part of an elaborate scheme to commit robbery or just a fun thing to do for some evil psychopath.  Or at least it may have been a terrorist attack that the Bush administration hadn't been hoping to encourage.  Hopefully we'll know what the real motivation for the bank bombing is soon enough, unlike the case of the anthrax attack that the FBI had been so eager to close despite the <a href="http://blog.chungyc.org/2008/09/apparent-flimsiness-of-anthrax-case/">facts still being so murky</a>.
