Via <a href="http://twitter.com/scifri/status/1034513020">NPR Science Friday on Twitter</a>: a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/zooillogix/2008/12/gay_penguins_steal_straight_co.php">gay penguin couple stole eggs from straight couples</a> in a zoo, replacing the eggs with rocks so the theft wouldn't be noticed right away.  That's what certain people must have meant when they claim that gay marriage would destroy family life.  Gay couples will steal all of the straight couples' children, and in humans but unlike penguins, straight couples would be too dumb to notice that their children have been replaced by baby dolls!
