The Hubble Space Telescope had taken a beautiful image of the Jupiter's largest moon <a
href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2008/news-2008-42.html">Ganymede going
behind Jupiter</a> on April, 2007.  It's the sort of picture I would have expected to have
been taken by <a
href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/galileo/overview/">Galileo</a> or the upcoming
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html">Juno</a> as they approach
the planet, not from a telescope so far away from Jupiter, which just shows how incredible
the eighteen year-old space telescope is.  Of course, while I would be happy with Hubble
taking pretty pictures for the sake of pretty pictures, those in charge of Hubble want
more bang for their buck, and scientists hope to learn more about Jupiter's atmosphere as
light reflected off of Ganymede passes through the planet's atmosphere.
