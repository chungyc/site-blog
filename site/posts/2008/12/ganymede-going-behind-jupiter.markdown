The Hubble Space Telescope had taken a beautiful image of the Jupiter's largest moon <a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/42/">Ganymede going behind Jupiter</a> on April, 2007.  It's the sort of picture I would have expected to have been taken by <a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/">Galileo</a> or the upcoming <a href="http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/juno">Juno</a> as they approach the planet, not from a telescope so far away from Jupiter, which just shows how incredible the eighteen year-old space telescope is.  Of course, while I would be happy with Hubble taking pretty pictures for the sake of pretty pictures, those in charge of Hubble want more bang for their buck, and scientists hope to learn more about Jupiter's atmosphere as light reflected off of Ganymede passes through the planet's atmosphere.
