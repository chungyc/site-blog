title: A look at a year of blogging

With the end of the first year that I have begun blogging on <a
href="https://blog.chungyc.org/">Stochastic Scribbles</a>, this seems to be a good time to
take a retrospective look at what I wrote about and list the more major posts.  Given my
interest in science, it's no surprise that a lot of the articles are about astronomy and
physics.  A lot of them were about spacecraft or astronomical discoveries in the news, but
there were also a few introductory science articles on things that I found interesting or
had wondered about.

On the other hand, I also wrote quite a bit about political matters.  I always thought myself to be rather apolitical, so the large portion of political content is somewhat of a surprise.  It might be an indication of what I think of the political state around the world, even though the presidential election in the United States was also a factor.

Given that I'm a laid-back atheist, I usually don't talk much about religion, but that doesn't mean I don't write about the topic at all.

<dd>Great good for one person can be a great evil for another, and vice versa.</dd>
</dl>

However, I still have open questions about some of the stuff I wrote about during the year.  I might never know the answer to some of these questions ...

<ul>
<li>Is dark flow real, and if so, what might be its cause?</li>
<li>Where was the water when a fork was stuck in Mars?</li>
<li>What's behind the flare-ups of Comet Holmes?</li>
<li>What's the source of the <a href="/2008/11/replenishing-methane-on-mars/">methane hotspots on Mars</a>?</li>
<li>I still haven't seen slam-dunk evidence, or even a particularly strong collection of weak evidence, for the <a href="/2008/09/apparent-flimsiness-of-anthrax-case/">accusations against Dr. Bruce Ivins</a>.</li>
<li>What is the real story behind the killing of a South Korean tourist by North Korea?</li>
</ul>

Here's hoping for another year of fruitful blogging, and have a Happy New Year!
