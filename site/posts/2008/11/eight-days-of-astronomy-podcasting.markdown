Do you love talking about astronomy?  Do you love the sound of your own voice?  Then consider <a href="http://365daysofastronomy.org/2008/11/23/january-podcasters-needed/">volunteering ten minutes of your voice</a> for some January episodes in the <a href="http://365daysofastronomy.org/">365 Days of Astronomy</a> podcast.  This is a podcast that broadcasts a listener-produced episode for every day of 2009, but it needs more courageous contributors for shows early in the year.  Particularly, they have eight days that still need to be filled in for January.

If I loved my voice and had the slightest bit of courage, I might be tempted to volunteer myself.  But I'm not, so maybe February ...
