There's a bit of cognitive dissonance hearing that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, one of
the most religiously oppressive countries in the world, both officially and unofficially,
made a <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/12/AR2008111202670.html">speech
about the need for religious tolerance</a>.  But condemning him as a hypocrite might be
far too premature.  If he really wants to spread religious tolerance within Saudi Arabia,
he'll have enough trouble dealing with domestic elements that will strongly resist such
efforts.  He doesn't need the rest of the world to pile on him, too.

On the other hand, if it's just a thinly veiled attempt to decry criticisms of Islam,
Saudi Arabia would deserve all the scorn it will get.  I just hope that this is not the
case.  I hope the speech is part of his baby steps as he tries to make his country freer.
Unfortunately, I do not know about the king well enough to have an opinion one way or the
other.
