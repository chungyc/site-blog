<p>
The results for the United States presidential election are coming in, so I thought I would keep track of the electoral votes using <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>.  It's sad (for me) to see that McCain is winning with 8 electoral votes over Obama's 3 electoral votes at the time I'm posting this, but of course, this is still way too early to say how the election will go.
