Sylvia Browne is a self-proclaimed psychic who is an outright liar or is delusional, given how wrong she almost always is and yet apparently completely lacking in empathy about the harm she causes in her victims.  In order to expose her frauds, Robert Lancaster had been maintaining a website documenting her wrongs, but recently an <a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3971">unscrupulous person has taken over his original domain</a> by taking advantage of its expiration while he was hospitalized.  He has been forced into moving the domain for the website, so we need to use the new domain to stop <a href="http://www.stopsylvia.com/">Sylvia Browne</a> and other fraudulent psychics like her.  (And sadly to say, the complete lack of evidence otherwise seems to indicate there's no other kind of psychic ...)
