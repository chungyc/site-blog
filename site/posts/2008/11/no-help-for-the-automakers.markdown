The government has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/business/03gm.html">refused
to financially help out General Motors</a> in its attempted merger with Chrysler.  This is
a bit surprising (although not all that much) since it's a common belief that the Bush
administration is partly in the pockets of fossil fuel-based domestic automakers (the rest
being in the pocket of oil companies).  On the other hand, it is consistent with the
Republican's free market policy.  What is rather more surprising is that the
administration is supporting a $25 billion loan program for fuel-efficient vehicles.

Given how badly US automakers have forecast trends in the automobile market, it's no
surprise that they're doing badly, and the current economic downturn only makes their
situation much worse.  Perhaps things would have been different if they didn't focus so
much on large vehicles and put in more resources into hybrid or electric cars, instead of
discontinuing development of vehicles such as the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1">EV1</a>.  Then again, their
problems might lie somewhere else so that they may still have ended up poorly.

I wonder if there will still be cars from GM or Ford in a couple of decades ...
