<a href="http://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a> has just successfully conducted a <a href="http://www.spacex.com/press.php?page=20081123">full duration test firing of the first stage for the Falcon 9 rocket</a> lasting almost three minutes, with all nine Merlin engines firing simultaneously.  Waking up all the neighbors aside, is this one major step closer to fully private manned space flight?
