With the elections on November 4th in the United States being over, the <a href="http://layscience.net/node/286">special election edition of the Carnival of the Liberals</a> is up at <a href="http://layscience.net/node">The Lay Scientist</a>.  It includes articles that focus on the election, organized by whether an article was written before or after.  My punditry as to <a href="/2008/11/where-mccain-went-wrong/">what went wrong with McCain's presidential campaign</a> is included in the latter category.

In the same vein, the <a href="http://numberwarrior.wordpress.com/2008/11/07/carnival-of-mathematics-43/">43rd edition of the Carnival of Mathematics</a> is up at <a href="http://numberwarrior.wordpress.com/">The Number Warrior</a>, which has a preponderance of puzzles this time around.  Among them is <a href="/2008/11/probability-of-probability/">my explanation</a> of a <a href="http://diracseashore.wordpress.com/2008/11/05/probabilities-in-physics/">puzzle of chance</a> presented at the <a href="http://diracseashore.wordpress.com/">Shores of the Dirac Sea</a>.
