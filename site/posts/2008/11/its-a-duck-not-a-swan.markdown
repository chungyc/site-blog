Stochastic scribble of the day:

<blockquote>
If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, and yet does not act like a swan at all, then it most probably <em>is</em> a duck, not a swan.
</blockquote>

(Substitute creationism, vitalism, flat earth, etc. for "it", myth or fantasy for "duck", and reality for "swan".)
