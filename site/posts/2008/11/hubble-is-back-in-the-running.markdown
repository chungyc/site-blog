The Hubble Space Telescope gave us a bit of a scare when <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2008/09/29/major-failure-on-the-hubble-space-telescope-repair-mission-options-being-weighed/">one of its networking equipment broke down</a> and even the <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/17/hubble-fix-hits-snag-is-delayed/">backup system looked like it failed</a>.  So it's great news that the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/37/">backup system is back in shape</a>, which they checked out by getting images of two interacting galaxies and having the telescope sending them to us.  It also means that the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/servicing_mission_4/">servicing mission to the Hubble</a> is back on track.  Not too bad for an eighteen-year old space telescope ...
