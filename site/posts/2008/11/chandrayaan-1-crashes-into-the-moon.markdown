Joining the rank of previous lunar impactors, the Moon Impact Probe from India's
Chandrayaan-1 has <a
href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081117132956.htm">successfully crashed
into the Moon</a>.  Now which country will be next to join the club of nations that have
sent probes to the Moon?  And how long will it take for India to send a successful lunar
lander?

One thing I haven't heard much about is new scientific results from the impactor.  I
wonder how they would compare with those that we'll get from <a
href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LCROSS/overview/index.html">LCROSS</a> next year?
