Joining the rank of previous lunar impactors, the Moon Impact Probe from India's Chandrayaan-1 has <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081117132956.htm">successfully crashed into the Moon</a>.  Now which country will be next to join the club of nations that have sent probes to the Moon?  And how long will it take for India to send a successful lunar lander?

One thing I haven't heard much about is new scientific results from the impactor.  I wonder how they would compare with those that we'll get from <a href="http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov/">LCROSS</a> next year?
