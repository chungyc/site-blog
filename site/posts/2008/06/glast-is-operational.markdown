GLAST, the space-based gamma-ray observatory from NASA, is now operational and has started
collecting data.  GLAST will be able to observe much higher energy gamma rays compared to
the Swift satellite, which should open a new view to the skies.

While it's a sure thing that GLAST will be observing known things such as gamma-ray bursts,
active galactic nuclei, and supernova remnants, it might even make breakthroughs in physics by observing

or violations of Lorentz invariance.
