is a hilarious podcast where they make fun of the weekly news.
It's a quiz show where the questions are hilarious,
and you'll discover things that you would never believe happening.
The intervening breaks where regular panelists try to guess the answer to a question are also really funny,
especially when they <em>don't</em> know the answer.

It's actually a radio show which is also being provided as a podcast.
I don't listen to the show through radio since I prefer podcasts,
not to mention that I don't even have a radio,
which means you'll probably never hear me on the show as a contestant.
