Do you want to keep up to date with Mac news?
I do, but I usually don't have the time to chase down rumors about Apple and the Mac.
So I get my news from the <a href="https://www.maccast.com/">MacCast</a>.
It's a weekly podcast which I listen to while I'm walking or exercising,
so I don't have to spend extra time trying to track down rumors about new Mac releases or useful Apple software.
