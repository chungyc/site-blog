The Mars Phoenix Lander has managed to take some <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/images/press/OM2_05JUN08_mhh.html">really close-up pictures of Mars dust</a>.  The picture was taken off of a silicon substrate which was exposed so that dust kicked off when the lander landed would stick to it.  I don't know what to make of the picture, but it still gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling to see something so microscopic from Mars.
