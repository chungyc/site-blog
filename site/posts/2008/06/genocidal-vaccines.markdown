<a href="https://www.respectfulinsolence.com/">Orac</a> talked about a comment which discussed how
<a href="https://www.respectfulinsolence.com/2008/06/04/green-our-vaccines-best-comment-evah/">anti-vaccine activists are trying to save the environment</a>.
I hadn't quite grasped the horrors of vaccines until I read that comment.
It's sad to think that the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/index.html">smallpox virus</a> has almost been eradicated.
It's also disturbing how close the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio">polio virus</a> came to suffering the same fate,
only to be saved by the tireless efforts of anti-vaccine activists.

And yes, I'm being sarcastic,
which I mention in case you're one of those people who think vaccines do not prevent disease at all and that it's part of some evil conspiracy.
