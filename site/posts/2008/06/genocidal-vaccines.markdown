<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/">Orac</a> talked about a comment which discussed how <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/green_our_vaccines_best_comment_evah.php">anti-vaccine activists are trying to save the environment</a>.  I hadn't quite grasped the horrors of vaccines until I read that comment.  It's sad to think that the <a href="http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/overview/disease-facts.asp">smallpox virus</a> has almost been eradicated.  It's also disturbing how close the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio">polio virus</a> came to suffering the same fate, only to be saved by the tireless efforts of anti-vaccine activists.

And yes, I'm being sarcastic, which I mention in case you're one of those people who think vaccines do not prevent disease at all and that it's part of some evil conspiracy.
