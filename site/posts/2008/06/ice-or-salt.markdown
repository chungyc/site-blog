Has the Mars Phoenix Lander uncovered ice that was buried under the soil?
While the blast from its thrusters when it landed <a href="/2008/05/ice-surface-on-mars/">may have uncovered ice</a>,
it's not reachable by the robotic arm.
In a trench dug up by the arm last week, named "Dodo-Goldilocks", the lander may have uncovered ice,
which is much more obvious in a color picture than in a black and white photograph.
Seeing white on a planet whose most popular color is red is a nice change.

Is the exposed white material ice or salts?  Or is it something else entirely?
Only after analysis with the TEGA instrument on the lander will we know.
