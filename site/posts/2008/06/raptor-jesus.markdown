There is a hilarious cult of Jesus Christ claiming that the <a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/06/join-raptor-jesus-cult.html">head of Jesus was that of a raptor</a>.  The sad thing is that the arguments for the claim were so similar to the types that some fundamentalist Christians use that I had to double check that it wasn't a real cult.  <a href="http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/Poe's_Law">Poe's Law</a> strikes again!

I wish it were the case that I could have dismissed it as satire immediately, but sadly it's the case that some Christians seriously believe some weird things and often employ confused arguments (like what some believe about <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-thermodynamics.html">thermodynamics</a> or the <a href="http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/faith_values/stories/2008/05/30/sickpray.ART_ART_05-30-08_B6_NAA9PCJ.html">power of prayer</a>).  It's sometimes really hard to figure out whether certain religious content is <a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0096/0096_01.asp">sincere</a> or <a href="http://www.landoverbaptist.org/">parody</a>.
