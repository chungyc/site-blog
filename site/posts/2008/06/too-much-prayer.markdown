Some people might think that there can never be such a thing as too much prayer.  So it's funny to notice that an Islamic <em>cleric</em> thinks that <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=080605081855.juhs9sqc">Egyptians pray too much</a>.  While I'm not against people praying in their own time, there's no way I can be fine with people spending more time praying than working <em>during work hours</em>.  I'm not sure if the average Egyptian is incredibly devout or if they're just using prayer as a state-sanctioned excuse for not working.  However, significant loss of productivity due to prayer is certainly not a downside I would have thought of coming from state-sponsored religion.
