A proposed constitutional amendment <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/02/BAMJ1125FV.DTL">managed to get on the ballot</a>.  Considering that an initiative needs get more than half a million signatures to become a ballot measure, it's slightly depressing to think that so many people want to restrict the happiness of others.  It would be understandable if gay marriages could bring harm to society, but there's no real reason why this would be so.

What's more depressing is that a measure to ban gay marriages actually passed in 2000.  I'll be charitable and assume that this was only because the whole concept was so new that people couldn't get their head around it.  I'm definitely going to vote against the proposed amendment, and I have a feeling a lot more people would be agreeing with me come this November than in 2000.
