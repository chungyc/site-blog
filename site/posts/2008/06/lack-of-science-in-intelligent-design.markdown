The blog that had used to be on the [Skeptic's Guide to the Universe](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) web site
had a post which talked about possible logical problems when criticizing intelligent design
and did a good job of explaining why such criticisms are not illogical.
I left a comment tangential to the question the blog post talked about,
and then I thought I might as well include it in my own blog since it's a rant that stands by itself:
