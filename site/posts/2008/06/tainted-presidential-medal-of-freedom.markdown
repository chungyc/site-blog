It's sad that the first thought that comes into my mind after hearing about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/us/11cnd-medal.html">six people receiving the Presidential Medal of Honor</a> is to wonder how horribly they must have screwed up.  After George W. Bush awarding the medal to several major screw-ups, the automatic reflex is to think that he likes people screwing up America.  I know it's stupid to automatically think that the medal recipients must have done something really bad (no doubt most of the recipients did some really good work).  I blame Bush.
