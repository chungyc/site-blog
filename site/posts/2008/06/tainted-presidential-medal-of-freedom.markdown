It's sad that the first thought that comes into my mind after hearing about
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/us/11cnd-medal.html">six people receiving the Presidential Medal of Honor</a>
is to wonder how horribly they must have screwed up.
After George W. Bush awarding the medal to several major screw-ups,
the automatic reflex is to think that he likes people screwing up America.
I know it's stupid to automatically think that the medal recipients must have done something really bad
(no doubt most of the recipients did some really good work).
I blame Bush.
