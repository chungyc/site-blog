Events sometimes tempt me to think that religious people, especially those in the priestly profession, blindly follow authority like sheep.  But every once in a while, I hear a nice story which reminds me that deeply religious people can be as moral and ethical as any other person.  After the start of same-sex marriages in California, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/us/18clergy.html">certain clergy members are conflicted about not being allowed to preside over such ceremonies by their church</a>.  They look at the happiness from same-sex marriage ceremonies and would like to contribute to such happiness for other gay couples, but they can't because the rules laid down by their religion forbids it.

It's a good reminder that the deeply religious are not just motivated by what other people say about their religion, but also by an inner empathy and a morality influenced by society.  I should always keep in mind that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2336409320070423">religious bigots</a> do not speak for all of the religious.
