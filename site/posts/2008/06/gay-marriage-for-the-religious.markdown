Events sometimes tempt me to think that religious people,
especially those in the priestly profession, blindly follow authority like sheep.
But every once in a while, I hear a nice story which reminds me that
deeply religious people can be as moral and ethical as any other person.
After the start of same-sex marriages in California, certain clergy members are conflicted about
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/us/18clergy.html">not being allowed to preside over such ceremonies by their church</a>.
They look at the happiness from same-sex marriage ceremonies
and would like to contribute to such happiness for other gay couples,
but they can't because the rules laid down by their religion forbids it.

It's a good reminder that the deeply religious are not just motivated
by what other people say about their religion,
but also by an inner empathy and a morality influenced by society.
I should always keep in mind that

do not speak for all of the religious.
