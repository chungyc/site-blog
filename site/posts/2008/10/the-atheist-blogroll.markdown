The <a
href="https://mojoey.blogspot.com/2006/09/join-mojoeys-atheist-blogroll.html">Atheist
Blogroll</a> is a list of blogs by atheists and agnostics maintained by Mojoey from <a
href="https://mojoey.blogspot.com/">Deep Thoughts</a>.  They're not all blogs exclusively
about atheism; like this blog, many of them are about a bewildering variety of subjects.
The one thing common among them is that none of the blog authors are religious and that
they occasionally talk about atheism or agnosticism every once in a while.

As an easy-going atheist, I mostly don't care what other people believe.  However, I do
care when people use fallacious arguments to justify their beliefs.  Sometimes I even get
my lazy self off the couch and engage in passionate debate about how their arguments suck.
At least I respect those who admit that their questionable beliefs are based on "just
because", but then I get into a righteous fury when some of them expect me to believe the
same way they do and try to coerce the rest of society to behave based on their isolated
beliefs.  Not that I get violent or anything: I'm a little too passive to be violent.

And as a blogger who also happens to be an atheist, I finally got myself to include this
blog in the Atheist Blogroll.  Stochastic Scribbles is now one of the steadily growing
number of atheistic blogs included in the Atheist Blogroll, which has been growing by a
little more than one blog per day since its inception.  At this rate, it will take only
about 15 million years before everyone on Earth is an atheist blogger, assuming the
population maxes out at six billion.
