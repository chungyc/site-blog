The <a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/">Friendly Atheist</a> mentions yet another case of someone <a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/4957/prayer-is-no-replacement-for-real-medical-care/">dying from an easily treatable condition</a> because they chose to rely on faith instead of modern medicine.  It's one thing to refuse an uncertain and dangerous medical treatment, but choosing wishful thinking over proven medical treatments is just stupid, even if it pains me to say so.  And if inflicted on someone else, it should indeed be considered criminal.

People should realize that when reality and pure wishful thinking collide, reality is always going to prevail.
