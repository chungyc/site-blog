The <a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> has taken <a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2008-18/">images of Comet Holmes</a>, the comet that suddenly flared late last year during its six-year orbit around the Sun.  The last time the comet erupted was over a hundred years ago, and astronomers are puzzled by what may have caused it to suddenly explode and brighten a millionfold.  The comet is also odd in that the streamers from the comet are no longer pointing away from the Sun as in most active comets.

I wonder what might be causing the comet to flare?  Crazy idea: the comet is a run-down automated starship that is trying to fix itself over a hundred year period but shoddy repairs cause the engine to sputter out.  Mundane idea: chemical reactions within the comet steadily raise pressure until it explodes.  A confession: I don't really have a clue.
