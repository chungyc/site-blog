Next year is also the <a href="http://www.astronomy2009.org/">International Year of Astronomy</a>, where a concerted effort will be made to promote astronomy and science education among the public.  It will be pursuing projects both at an international and a national level, with participation from more than a hundred countries.  This would be a great chance for astronomy lovers to help out spreading the astronomy.

If you have a blog or other web site that has astronomy as a major theme, then you might want to consider <a href="http://www.PortalToTheUniverse.org/EarlyBirdReg/">registering it with the Portal to the Universe</a> that I <a href="/2008/08/portal-to-the-universe/">previously blogged about</a>.  I wonder if there's anything else I could do besides registering my own blog and donating?
