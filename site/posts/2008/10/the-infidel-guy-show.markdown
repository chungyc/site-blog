The <a href="http://www.infidelguy.com/">Infidel Guy Show</a> is a great online radio show hosted by Reginald Finley, the Infidel Guy.  He regularly conducts live interviews with atheists, agnostics, theists, and all sorts of other people.  It's a down to earth look at a wide variety of topics that may be of interest to atheists, among them religion (of course), science, politics, and culture.  You could also jump into the show by calling in via phone or Skype.

The Infidel Guy Show supports itself through ad revenue and donations from listeners.  Unfortunately, not enough revenue has been coming in recently with the downturn in the economy, threatening the existence of this great program.  If you're one of the audience that enjoys this show, please consider becoming a paid Gold Member or even just making a donation.
