In yet another demonstration of its awesomeness, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter managed to get an <a href="http://tomsastroblog.com/?p=2131">image of the Spirit rover from orbit</a> using HiRISE, even though the rover only shows up as a dark dot.  For rovers that have been on Mars for almost five years, Spirit and its twin Opportunity are still going pretty strong.
