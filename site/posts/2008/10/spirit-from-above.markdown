In yet another demonstration of its awesomeness, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter managed
to get an <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/20081009_Spirit.html">image of the
Spirit rover from orbit</a> using HiRISE, even though the rover only shows up as a dark
dot.  For rovers that have been on Mars for almost five years, Spirit and its twin
Opportunity are still going pretty strong.
