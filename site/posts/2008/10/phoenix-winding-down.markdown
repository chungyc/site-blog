The Mars Phoenix Lander has started to shut itself down as the Martian
winter approaches.  With the days becoming shorter, it's getting less
and less power from its solar panels that powers its electronics and
its five heaters.  To conserve power, it has shut down operation of
its first survival heater, which had been keeping some of the lander's
electronics within a reasonable temperature range.

All except one of the survival heaters will be switched off one by one
as the available power decreases, with more and more instruments being
exposed to temperature extremes.  NASA will be stretching it out as
much as possible to keep the lander operational.  However, we are
already seeing operations deteriorate as a power fault has forced the
lander to switch to using backup systems.
