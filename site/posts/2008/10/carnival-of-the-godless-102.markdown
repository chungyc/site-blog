The 102th edition of the Carnival of the Godless is up at <a href="http://dbzer0.com/blog/carnival-of-the-godless-102-mission-impossible">A Division by Zer0</a>.  The blog posts for this edition are woven around the God of Atheism and its jaunt around the impossible.  It also mentions the rather absurd case of an <a href="/2008/06/too-much-prayer/">Islamic cleric discouraging prayer</a> I blogged about a few months ago.
