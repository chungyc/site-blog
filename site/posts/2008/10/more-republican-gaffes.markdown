I'm not much of a strict nitpicker who considers any gaffe by a political campaign to be a
huge black mark against them, but I <em>am</em> easily amused.  So even though I don't
consider these really much of an issue politically, I was just too amused by two gaffes
made by the McCain-Palin campaign that I just need to mention them.

The first is a speech by McCain in Pennsylvania, where McCain tries to pander to the
audience by contrasting himself with Obama's supporters, but instead ends up with a rather
awkward moment as he misspeaks:

> I think you may have noticed that Senator Obama's supporters have been saying some
> pretty nasty things about western Pennsylvania lately.  ...  And you know?  I couldn't
> agree with them more. ...

Like the phone conversation where
[McCain supposedly rejects Spain](https://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1643290_1643292_1847933,00.html)
which I think was a miscommunication resulting from a
garbled phone conversation, I interpret his remarks as a slip of the tongue that is
meaningless politically.  But it's hard not to find it amusing.  However, I'd be mighty
annoyed yet again if the McCain campaign tries mind-blowing contortions to make things
look like McCain said exactly what he meant to say but that everyone else misinterpreted him.

The second gaffe is the news about [Palin's $$150,000 wardrobe](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/us/politics/23palin.html)
While I completely understand the McCain-Palin campaign's need to make
Palin and her family look sharp for the cameras, I can't help but feel a bit of cognitive
dissonance with their effort to make Palin seem like an average American hockey mom.
Having several years' worth of the average American's income spent within a couple of
months on clothes and accessories tends to do that.

As I said, I don't really think these gaffes are meaningful politically, and I don't
consider them examples of disdain for average people or hypocrisy, but they're pretty
amusing.  It makes me wonder if my satire about the [Republican Party trying to be funny](/2008/10/vote-mccain-for-president/)
contains a kernel of truth ...
