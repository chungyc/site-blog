Sarah Palin is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/opinion/08wed1.html">quoted</a> as having said the following about Barack Obama:

<blockquote cite="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/opinion/08wed1.html">
This is not a man who sees America as you see it and how I see America.
</blockquote>

To which I would say:

<blockquote>
Damn right he doesn't see America like you do.  Obama and most Americans see America as a democratic nation with justice and liberty for all, while you and the tiny minority of your supporters see America as a wannabe Christian theocracy that continues to fail to reach the heights achieved by the Taliban.
</blockquote>

Or am I being too unfair to her?
