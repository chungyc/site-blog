Sarah Palin is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/opinion/08wed1.html">quoted</a>
as having said the following about Barack Obama:

> This is not a man who sees America as you see it and how I see America.

To which I would say:

> Damn right he doesn't see America like you do.  Obama and most Americans see America as
> a democratic nation with justice and liberty for all, while you and the tiny minority of
> your supporters see America as a wannabe Christian theocracy that continues to fail to
> reach the heights achieved by the Taliban.

Or am I being too unfair to her?
