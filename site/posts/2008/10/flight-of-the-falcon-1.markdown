Via the <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/10/high-roller/">Bad Astronomer</a>, I learned about the cool <a href="http://spacex.com/multimedia/videos.php?id=31">music video</a> that <a href="http://spacex.com/">SpaceX</a> has released showing footage from their successful launch of the Falcon 1 rocket.  I'm going to put it on my iPod.  <a href="http://www.spacex.com/falcon1.php">Falcon 1</a> is the first successful rocket that was privately designed from scratch to reach orbit.  It looks like a bargain compared to existing rockets maintained by national governments, with an $8 million price tag for about a half a ton payload.

I'm also looking forward to a successful launch of their planned <a href="http://www.spacex.com/falcon9.php">Falcon 9</a> rocket with anticipation.  If things work out, then we could have manned space flights by a purely private company within a few years.  Not to mention that NASA would have a relatively cheap way to put people in space when the Shuttle is retired, without having to rely on Russia.

I do have a secret desire to see Japan's proposed $10 billion project for a <a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=335">space elevator</a> succeed.  It's rather far-fetched but within the realm of possibility: I might actually be able to afford to reach orbit within my lifetime.
