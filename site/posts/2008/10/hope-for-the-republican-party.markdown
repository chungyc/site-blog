The news is abuzz about
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/us/politics/20campaign.html">Colin Powell endorsing Barack Obama</a>.
The buzz might be mostly focused on a prominent Republican endorsing a Democratic
candidate, but to me the important thing about this news is that the Republican Party is
not a total lost cause yet.

Given my criticisms of the Republican Party, one might think that I'm a rabid Democrat.
But I'm not particularly enthralled by the Democratic platform.  Rather, it's that the
Republican Party has been sucking so much that the Democratic Party automatically becomes
the lesser of two evils.  I want all three branches of the government to base decisions on
reality and at least know what they're doing.  I want them to have a respect for human
dignity and civil rights.  I want them to be honest and respect all Americans, not just
those that agree with them.  The Republican Party has been flunking miserably in all these
respects and has been tempting me to write them off as hopeless, but Colin Powell makes me
think that there still might be hope for the Republican Party yet.

As Colin Powell announced his endorsement of Barack Obama on NBC's <cite>Meet the
Press</cite>, he argued many points that I wholeheartedly agree with, some of which are:

*   The McCain campaign seems to be flailing about with little idea of what they're doing,
    in contrast with the Obama campaign which has been much more measured.

*   The McCain campaign and their supporters trying to imply that Obama is a Muslim is bad
    enough in that it's not even true.  But America is a country that values equality and
    diversity: the implication that being a Muslim is bad in itself is just so
    anti-American.

*   The McCain campaign spends so much effort on dubious attacks against Obama that no one
    really cares about except for a narrow demographic.

While I would probably still disagree on many things with reasonable Republicans such as
Colin Powell, at least I can respect them.  (Despite his role in the build-up to the Iraq
War, he always seemed to me as an outsider from Bush's hawkish inside circle.  And while I
wouldn't absolve him of all responsibility, it feels like he was duped to some degree like
the rest of us.)  In fact, I would probably disagree with a moderate Republican Party as
much as I would disagree with the Democratic Party.  The Republican Party needs more
reasonable members like Colin Powell, otherwise politics becomes too boring as I would
always side with the Democrats.

Or maybe not.  The current state of the Republican Party does make for <a
