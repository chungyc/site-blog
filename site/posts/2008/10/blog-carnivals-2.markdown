The Tangled Bank #116, the blog carnival for all things science with an emphasis on the
life sciences, and the Giant's Shoulders #4, the blog carnival for classic science papers
and other historical science tidbits, are up at <a
href="https://kriswager.blogspot.com/">Pro-science</a> and <a
href="https://doctorsilence.blogspot.com/">second order approximation</a>, respectively,
with a mention of my own <a href="/2008/10/137/">137</a>, my expose of the history of the
fine-structure constant and its significance.

For lovers of all things space, the <a
href="https://lablemminglounge.blogspot.com/2008/10/space-carnival-has-biggest-tent-this.html">Carnival
of Space #75</a> is up at the <a href="https://lablemminglounge.blogspot.com/">Lounge of
the Lab Lemming</a> with mention of my discussion of why <a
href="/2008/09/why-dark-matter-is-more-diffuse-than-ordinary-matter/">dark matter doesn't
just gravitationally collapse</a>.

Skeptical readers can take a look at the 98th Skeptic's Circle on the Uncredible Hallq,
including my article that we need not <a
href="/2008/10/drowning-real-cures-among-quack-cures/">lose hope at the pervasiveness of
medical quackery</a>.
