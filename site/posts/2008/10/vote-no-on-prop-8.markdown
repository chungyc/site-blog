Elections in California are less than a month away.  Among the items on the ballot is Proposition 8, a <a href="http://blog.chungyc.org/2008/06/gay-marriage-ban-initiative-in-california/">proposed ban on gay marriage</a>.  If you are a Californian voter who is against such a ban and want to spread the word, then you might be interested in <a href="http://www.noonprop8.com/">No On 8</a>, a web site dedicated against Proposition 8.  It explains what's in the proposition and why it should be voted against.  There is also material you can use to show your support, and for those who can afford to do so and have the desire, you can also donate to the campaign.
