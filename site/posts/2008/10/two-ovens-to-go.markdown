As the sun is steadily getting lower around the north pole of Mars, the [Mars Phoenix
Lander](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/main/index.html) has managed to scoop
soil into its sixth oven out of the eight that came with TEGA, the thermal and evolved-gas
analyzer.  Now there are two ovens left, and hopefully the lander will be able to make use
of them before the sun drops below the horizon for the winter.  Meanwhile, the lander
would also serve as a weather station observing [snow
falling](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080929.html) and
[clouds in the sky](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/images/press/16405.html).
