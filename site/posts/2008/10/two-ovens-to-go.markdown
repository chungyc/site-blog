As the sun is steadily getting lower around the north pole of Mars, the Mars Phoenix Lander has managed to <a href="http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/10_17_pr.php">scoop soil into its sixth oven</a> out of the eight that came with TEGA, the thermal and evolved-gas analyzer.  Now there are two ovens left, and hopefully the lander will be able to make use of them before the sun drops below the horizon for the winter.  Meanwhile, the lander would also serve as a weather station observing <a href="http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/09_29_pr.php">snow falling</a> and <a href="/2008/09/martian-clouds-from-phoenix/">clouds in the sky</a>.  And what is going on with the <a href="/2008/09/mystery-of-the-missing-water/">mystery of the unexpectedly dry Martian soil</a>?
