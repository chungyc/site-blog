If you want to learn about astronomy, <a href="http://www.astronomycast.com/">Astronomy Cast</a> is a great podcast to listen to.  It's a podcast that introduces the general public to diverse topics in astronomy.  It not only explains what we know about astronomy, but <em>how</em> we know about things in astronomy (paraphrasing their slogan).

When it first started, I thought I would not learn anything new since most of the topics were those that I had read or heard about before, but I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out that the podcast goes deeper into things without making things difficult.
