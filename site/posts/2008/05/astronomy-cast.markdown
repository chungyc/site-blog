If you want to learn about astronomy, [Astronomy Cast](http://www.astronomycast.com/)
is a great podcast to listen to.
It's a podcast that introduces the general public to diverse topics in astronomy.
It not only explains what we know about astronomy,
but _how_ we know about things in astronomy (paraphrasing their slogan).

When it first started,
I thought I would not learn anything new since most of the topics
were those that I had read or heard about before,
but I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out
that the podcast goes deeper into things without making things difficult.
