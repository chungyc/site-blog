This is really cool: NASA has managed to <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080526.html">photograph the image of a spacecraft descending on another planet</a>.  The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter managed to take a picture of the Mars Phoenix Lander as it was descending with its parachute deployed.  While the image is not sharp at all, it's really impressive when I think of what it's showing.
