This is really cool: NASA has managed to photograph the image of
a [spacecraft descending on another planet](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080526.html).
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter managed to take a picture of
the Mars Phoenix Lander as it was descending with its parachute deployed.
While the image is not sharp at all, it's really impressive when I think of what it's showing.
