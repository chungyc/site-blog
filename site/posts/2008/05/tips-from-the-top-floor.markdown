<p>
If you like photography, then <a href="http://www.tipsfromthetopfloor.com/">Tips from the Top Floor</a> is a nice podcast to listen to.  It has a rather cozy feel to it, in that the podcast is very community-driven, and it often gives out nice tips and background knowledge that budding photographers can appreciate.  The semi-regular Tech Guy episodes, which are actually recordings from a separate radio show done with also the host of the Tips from the Top Floor podcast, are also great for learning basic photography techniques and other tidbits.
