If you like photography, then [Tips from the Top Floor](https://www.tipsfromthetopfloor.com/)
is a nice podcast to listen to.
It has a rather cozy feel to it, in that the podcast is very community-driven,
and it often gives out nice tips and background knowledge that budding photographers can appreciate.
The semi-regular Tech Guy episodes,
which are actually recordings from a separate radio show done
with also the host of the Tips from the Top Floor podcast,
are also great for learning basic photography techniques and other tidbits.
