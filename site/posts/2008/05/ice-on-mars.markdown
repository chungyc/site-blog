The Mars Phoenix Lander may have taken its <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080530.html">first close-up look at ice on Mars</a>.  While it's been known for a while that water exists on Mars, this would be the first time humans have been able to take a close look at actual water on Mars, assuming that it's not just some rock that looks like ice.
