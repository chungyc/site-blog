The Mars Phoenix Lander may have taken its
[first close-up look at ice on Mars](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080530.html).
While it's been known for a while that water exists on Mars,
this would be the first time humans have been able to take a close look at actual water on Mars,
assuming that it's not just some rock that looks like ice.
