<p>
I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/podcasts.html">podcasts</a>.  Unlike radio or TV, I'm not forced to listen at a specific time.  I can listen whenever I want as time becomes available, which makes it great when I'm driving or on long walks.  The only downside is also due to its upside: because a podcast is not done live I cannot interact in any way while the podcast is being recorded.  It's not really much of a problem since I'm asocial, so I wouldn't try to call in anyways to a live show.
