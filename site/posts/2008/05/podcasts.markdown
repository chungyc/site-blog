I'm a big fan of podcasts.
Unlike radio or TV, I'm not forced to listen at a specific time.
I can listen whenever I want as time becomes available,
which makes it great when I'm driving or on long walks.
The only downside is also due to its upside:
because a podcast is not done live I cannot interact in any way
while the podcast is being recorded.
It's not really much of a problem since I'm asocial,
so I wouldn't try to call in anyways to a live show.
