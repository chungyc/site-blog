Hearing about the
[death of a woman due to the failure of her iron lung](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/u-s-woman-dies-iron-lung-after-power-failure-flna1c9463312)
inspires both sadness and respect.
Being forced to live within an iron lung from almost when she was born because of polio,
it is awe-inspiring that she still managed to live a fulfilling life
despite her almost claustrophobic environment.
It is sad that such a woman had to die because of
the simultaneous failure of the normal power grid and the emergency generator.

This makes me think how good it is that [polio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio)
has almost been wiped out.
Otherwise we would have many more people who would have to live in such a restricted condition,
ranging from being paralyzed to having to rely on an iron lung.
Considering that this is thanks to vaccines,
I find it incomprehensible that some people are against vaccination
because of their bogus belief that it can cause autism.

It might be different if there were any evidence for such a belief,
but when [multiple high-quality studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8694782/)
show no link between vaccination and autism, they're just trying to spread suffering and death from disease.
I have no idea if this is out of malice or out of stupidity.
While it's my nature to assume the latter,
their vitriolic persistence in their belief despite strong evidence
to the contrary sometimes makes me suspect the former.
