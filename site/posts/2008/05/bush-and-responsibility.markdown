I can't believe that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/washington/01bush.html">Bush would preach responsibility</a>
when he is the great dodger of responsibility.
Or is he planning to admit responsibility to all the screw-ups that happened during his administration?
Really, he should be the first one to follow his own words,
otherwise he'd never even try to fix things.
Not that he could do much with less than a year left.
