<p>
<a href="http://www.audible.com/">Audiobooks</a> are like podcasts except much longer.  They're actually books read aloud by a narrator.  Like podcasts, they're nice for when you aren't able to sit down and read a book but would still want something to "read".  Unlike podcasts, however, they're a bit harder to pause and resume listening at a later date.
