<a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/">The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe</a> is one of my favorite podcasts.  It discusses what's wrong with the woo woo stuff out there in a common sense manner, has great humor, and is very informative overall.  Listening to it is a great way to fortify yourself from being duped by con artists or self-delusions such as the paranormal or alternative medicine.

Of course, the reason I don't believe in woo woo stuff is not just because they're woo woo, but because there's no evidence for them.  If anyone could show rigorously that things like telepathy exists then I'd believe them, but areas such as the paranormal or alternative medicine are so full of con artists or arguments from assertion that it's hard to take any of them seriously.
