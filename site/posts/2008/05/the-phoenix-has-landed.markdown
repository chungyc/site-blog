The <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/main/index.html">Mars Phoenix Lander</a> has successfully landed on Mars and is successfully transmitting back to Earth.  This is cool news.  It worried me a bit that it might crash like the <a href="http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/">Mars Polar Lander</a> did back in 2000.  Guess it wasn't the Martians who shot down the Polar Lander...
