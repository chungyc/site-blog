The [Mars Phoenix Lander](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/main/index.html)
has successfully landed on Mars and is successfully transmitting back to Earth.
This is cool news.
It worried me a bit that it might crash like the
[Mars Polar Lander](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars-exploration/missions/polar-lander/) did back in 2000.
Guess it wasn't the Martians who shot down the Polar Lander ...
