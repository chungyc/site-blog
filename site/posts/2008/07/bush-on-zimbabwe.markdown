To show that President George Bush is not totally out of touch of what democracy means, he views the <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gslOB5QBEq5jayxKzMj-fNEznupA">rigged presidential elections in Zimbabwe</a> negatively.  The sanctions that the United States has suggested to the United Nations are the sort that seem to be more focused on punishing the government rather than the citizens, such as an arms embargo and a travel ban.  He might actually be letting the US government do something right for a change.

Rabid anti-Bush fanatic that I am, however, I can't miss the opportunity to point out that he should have ordered a thorough investigation of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61930-2005Jan9.html">voting irregularities in his own election</a>, instead of leaving it to the opposition party to make a wishy-washy investigation.  If it were up to me, I consider voting fraud an extreme threat to democracy so that I would have had any such allegations investigated thoroughly, even if the election results had been in my own favor.
