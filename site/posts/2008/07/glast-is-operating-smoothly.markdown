NASA's space-based gamma-ray observatory <a href="http://glast.gsfc.nasa.gov/">GLAST</a> is <a href="http://wiki.nasa.gov:80/cm/blog/GLAST/posts/post_1215390982680.html">working smoothly</a>, and they have made available images of the <a href="http://www-glast.stanford.edu/WiredAnimation/">detection of individual gamma rays</a>.  After a few weeks, when GLAST would have collected tons of these events and had time to process them, they will be releasing images of the sky as seen with gamma-rays.  Considering that GLAST can detect gamma-rays with high energies that have never been systematically observed before, we might get to see things that we've never even suspected of before.

In other news, NASA plans to rename GLAST in a few weeks at the same time it releases images from the observatory.
