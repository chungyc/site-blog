I'm changing the name of this blog from <cite>Yoo's Ramblings</cite>
to <cite>Stochastic Scribbles</cite>.
One reason was to make it less ego-centric
(or I should have gone all the way with "Yoo Chung's Blog"
rather than the half-baked "Yoo's Ramblings"),
and another was that it gives the nice, evil-looking initials SS.
Somehow YR does not look as impressive ...
