I wish I'll eventually be able to afford a trip on the <a href="http://www.space.com/news/080728-whiteknight2-rollout.html">WhiteKnightTwo</a> that was recently rolled out.  Even better would be a ride on the yet incomplete <a href="http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/01/23/601315.aspx">SpaceShipTwo</a>, the spaceplane that will take passengers on a suborbital trip near the edge of space.  It would be a blast of a ride, with exhilarating G-forces on the way up and a few minutes of free fall at the top.  And the view will no doubt be breathtaking.  Although I do wonder if it's feasible to take a camera up with you and take pictures.  You might be enjoying free fall and the view too much to spare any attention for taking pictures!

At $20,000 a ride, the first of which will probably be in a couple of years, the price is far too steep for the average proletariat like me.  At least the price includes training on the WhiteKnightTwo and the actual suborbital ride on SpaceShipTwo, and prices might actually drop to an affordable level within my lifetime.  Of course, a few years after <a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/">Virgin Galactic</a> starts its suborbital flights, I'll probably also start pining for a stay at a space hotel, like the one <a href="http://www.bigelowaerospace.com/">Bigelow Aerospace</a> is hoping to launch within the decade.  It would be even more out of my price range, though, with millions of dollars required for a single stay.
