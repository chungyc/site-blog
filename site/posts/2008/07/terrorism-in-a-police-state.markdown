The Bush administration has consistently claimed that the government must expand their power and restrict the rights of citizens in order to maintain security and prevent terrorist attacks.  They have aimed for <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0806/p99s04-duts.html">warrantless wiretaps</a>, indefinite <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19172214/">detention</a> and <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/01/national/main3441363.shtml">torture</a> of so-called "enemy combatants", <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-te.md.spy18jul18,0,3787307.story">spying</a> on peaceful activist groups, <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040816/hightower">suppression</a> of non-violent protests, etc.  I bet they would even love to control the mass media, although they appear to be compensating using the "fair and balanced" <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/">FOX News</a>, a news network that blatantly displays its bias in favor of the conservative right.

So it's ironic when there is a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/22/AR2008072201403.html">bomb attack</a> in China, a police state of the sort that the Bush administration can only achieve in their dreams.  Even with an oppressive level of control over the populace, China still hasn't been able to prevent <a href="http://pacificempire.org.nz/?p=253">terrorist attacks</a> on their soil.  Is a significant erosion of civil rights worth the prevention of a few terrorist attacks?  Given that a nation much more like a genuine police state still suffers from plenty of terrorist attacks, I'm somewhat dubious whether expanded government power at the price of civil rights would actually help prevent any terrorist attacks at all.  Some might even be able to make the case that it would actually motivate more terrorism.
