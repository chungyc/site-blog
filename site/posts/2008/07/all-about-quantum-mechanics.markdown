For the average person who is interested in quantum mechanics, Sean Carroll and David Albert will be <a href="http://cosmicvariance.com/2008/07/07/everything-you-every-wanted-to-know-about-quantum-mechanics-but-were-afraid-to-ask/">talking about the subject</a> at <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/">Bloggingheads.tv</a>.  <a href="http://preposterousuniverse.com/">Sean Carroll</a> is a physicist at <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/">CalTech</a>, while <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/philosophy/fac-bios/albert/faculty.html">David Albert</a> is a philosopher of science at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>.

Sean Carroll is <a href="http://cosmicvariance.com/2008/07/07/everything-you-every-wanted-to-know-about-quantum-mechanics-but-were-afraid-to-ask/">soliciting questions about quantum mechanics</a> that you might be curious about.  One of the things they will probably talk about is how superpositions in quantum mechanics makes things different from classical mechanics.  And from the comments so far, they will probably also talk about the various interpretations of quantum mechanics (and there are a <em>lot</em> of them, almost all of which give the same predictions in practice), and there will probably be a lot of discussion of wave collapse, which is the same as measurement in quantum mechanics.
