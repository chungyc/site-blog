During the past decades, traffic congestion and parking space shortages have been steadily growing worse in Korea.  While there are various efforts to reduce the problems from the growing number of cars, such as better road systems and traffic control, the country has one odd method that has been employed for awhile.  Many institutions enforce a rule of only allowing people to commute with cars whose license plate number ends in certain numbers for each day.

It started with a 10-turn system, where each number from 0 to 9 in turn was barred from parking at the institution's parking lot.  For example, on the first day cars whose license plate number ended with a 0 would not be allowed to park, on the second day cars whose plate number ended with 1 would be barred, and so on until the tenth day, where those that ended with a 9 were barred.  And on the next day they would turn the whole cycle back to the beginning and start barring plates whose number ended with a 0.  This would supposedly reduce the number of cars that were used to commute daily to the institution to 90% of what it would otherwise be.

After a several years, some institutions started to use a 5-turn system, where instead of each ending number being barred from their parking lots for each day, <em>two</em> numbers would be barred.  So instead of banning the digit 0 on the first day, the digit 1 on the second day, and so on, they started to ban the digits 0 and 5 on the first day, the digits 1 and 6 on the second day, and so on.  The idea was obviously that it would cut the number of commuting cars, and hence the required parking space, to 80%.

Unfortunately, such rules are only a band-aid to the problem of increasing number of cars.  While these rules can only impose a linear reduction on the number of commuting cars, the increase of the number of cars has been exponential, growing along with the population growth and per capita income.  There is no way that these rules could catch up with the growth in the number of cars, and it does nothing for the rest of the country, where commercial areas do not enforce such rules because they would be turning away customers and residential areas need the parking space and roads for everyone who lives in the areas.

The rules only serve as a temporary and eventually ineffective solution to the problems due to the growing number of cars.  I don't know what the solutions could be, perhaps better mass transportation and better ways of life such as telecommuting to reduce the need for cars, but the rotary commuting rules don't help much and just inconvenience outsiders that need to visit institutions that employ such rules.  It might have the positive effect of being an incentive to a tiny portion of the population to use mass transit instead of commuting by car, though.

Now the Korean government is <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/06/asia/AS-SKorea-Energy-Saving-Campaign.php">suggesting a 2-turn system for public institutions</a>.  While the goal is to reduce energy costs rather than traffic congestion, it's still pretty much a token gesture since the fuel costs for commuting to public institutions is a rather miniscule portion of the total fuel consumption in Korea.  More pressure on Korean auto makers to manufacture energy-efficient cars might have been more worthwhile, considering that they have been rather <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2008/03/123_21222.html">slow to develop hybrid cars for the general market</a>.
