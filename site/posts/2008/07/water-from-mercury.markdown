While a <a href="/2008/06/evaporating-ice-on-mars/">direct and close-up observation of
water on Mars</a> is exciting, we already knew about the existence of water on Mars for
quite awhile.  But the solar system can still throw us big surprises.  One might think
that the planet Mercury would not have any water, being so close to the Sun so that any
water would have been blasted away by the solar wind.  But when the
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/main/index.html">MESSENGER
spacecraft</a> made its initial flyby of Mercury this January, water was exactly what it
detected in its atmosphere.

MESSENGER is to orbit Mercury starting from 2011, but to save fuel it approaches Mercury
numerous times to reduce its speed using Mercury's gravitational pull.  During its flyby
in January, it flew through Mercury's thin atmosphere and collected particles from the
atmosphere.  While it found the expected amount of elements such as sodium, potassium, and
calcium, it also

significant amounts of water</a> among the particles, which was a complete surprise.

The MESSENGER spacecraft has already made several big discoveries in just a single flyby
this January, the <a href="https://messenger.jhuapl.edu/Resources/Articles.html">others</a>
being the fact that volcanism is responsible for the smooth plains of Mercury and that
many of the planet's features are due to its shrinking iron core.  With just one flyby
resulting in significant scientific results, including the unexpected detection of water
in Mercury's atmosphere, I think we can look forward to when MESSENGER <em>really</em>
starts its mission in 2011 when it goes into orbit around the planet.  Even bigger
surprises are sure to come.
