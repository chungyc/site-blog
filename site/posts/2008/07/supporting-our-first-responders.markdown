According to <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a>, Dr. John Howard, the director of the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a>, will be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/04/health/policy/04health.html">dismissed</a>.  He oversaw the healthcare for 9/11 first responders, many of whom have respiratory problems, but he was ousted because he cares too much about the workers.

Congress had approved a budget to provide healthcare for the first responders, and Dr. Howard faithfully followed their dictates in providing healthcare.  However, the Bush administration wanted him to use a smaller budget, so they will not be reappointing him as director.  So much about them supporting the people fighting terrorism; they don't even want to provide proper healthcare to the first responders of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks">largest terrorist attack in the history of the United States</a>.

This whole affair is ridiculous, but it's sadly what we've come to expect from the Bush administration.  For a group of people who claim to support the troops and accuse others of not supporting them, they have a tendency to cut off support such as <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/03/19/dems.radio/">veteran's health care</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/26/opinion/26mon1.html">education</a>.  And yet when support is approved by the opposition in Congress, they have the gall to try and <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/16047.html">take credit for it</a>.
