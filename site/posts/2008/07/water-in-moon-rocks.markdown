Our Moon is known for being a very dry place with no water at all,
except possibly for <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/ice/ice_moon.html">some ice
at the poles</a>.  And researchers have not been able to find any in
the lunar rocks brought back from the Apollo missions until recently.
However, according to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/">Scientific American</a>,
they have now
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/moon-once-harbored-water/">found trace amounts of water in lunar volcanic glasses</a>
brought back from the Apollo missions.

Previous attempts at finding water in the lunar rocks failed because
researchers could not tell whether any water detected was truly part
of the original lunar material or whether they were Earth-based
contaminants.  Using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_ion_mass_spectrometry">secondary
ion mass spectrometry</a>, researchers were finally able to discover
that lunar volcanic glasses contained water in a concentration of
about 46 parts per million.  Based on this, they estimate that the
Moon once must have had water concentrations of 750 parts per million
in its mantle.

It shouldn't have come as a surprise, since the Moon probably formed
from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis">impact of
a Mars-sized body with the Earth</a>, so plenty of water must have
been mixed in the impact debris.  But after thinking of the Moon as a
completely dry body for a long time, the news of the discovery had an
impact.
