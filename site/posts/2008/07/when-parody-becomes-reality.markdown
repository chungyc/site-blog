Seven years ago, when the Onion published a <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784">parody article</a> about a speech by Bush which blatantly has him declaring his intentions to destroy the peace and prosperity of America, I would have found the article hilarious.  But now that we have gone through seven years of the Bush presidency, it's incredibly depressing to find how much in the article have actually been achieved.  Only a few things in the parody speech have not come true, such as there being no tax hike that was to follow the tax cuts, and the ban on oil drilling in certain regions is still in effect, although the administration is doing its hardest to lift the latter.

When there is a parody speech with the president advocating harm to one's own country, one would expect that the authors and readers to think that a real president would not aim to achieve most of the things mentioned in the speech.  So it's very hard not to think that there's something terribly wrong with the government of the United States when most of them have indeed been accomplished.
