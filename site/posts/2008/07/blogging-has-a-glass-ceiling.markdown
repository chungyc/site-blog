It's been reported that while a roughly comparable number of men and women blog,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/fashion/27blogher.html">blogs maintained by women
apparently attract less attention</a>.  Some women believe that it's because people tend
to take a woman's blog less seriously than that of a man.  I have to wonder if this is
really the case.  In most of the blogs I read and comment on, I don't even know if the
writer is a man or a woman, and frankly, I don't care.  For that matter, I often don't
even have a clue about a writer's race, age, job, etc.  Am I an anomaly?  Are there really
so many people who read blogs depending on the writer's gender?
