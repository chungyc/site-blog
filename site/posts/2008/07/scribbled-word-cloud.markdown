Generating word clouds from <a href="http://wordle.net/">Wordle</a> seems to be an up and coming fad.  Based on words that appear on a web site or blog, Wordle generates an image of a cloud of words based on how often they appear and laid out in a hopefully aesthetic manner.  It's a Java applet, so there isn't any worry that generating images will overload the Wordle server.  <a href="http://cosmicvariance.com/2008/07/22/words-in-the-clouds/">Cosmic Variance</a> and the <a href="http://uslhc.us/blogs/?p=267">US/LHC Blogs</a> are two sites that have already succumbed to the fad.  With such prestigious precursors, who am I not to follow?

Generating a word cloud for this blog, it appears that I've talked a lot about North Korea.  This is somewhat surprising since I'm usually not very interested in keeping track of the totalitarian state.  I'm probably talking about them a lot recently because they're acting even more oppressively than usual such that they're causing incidents which even I can't help but comment on.  Other things that the word cloud indicates are that I appear to maintain an interest in Mars exploration and that I might have a thing for "incidents".
