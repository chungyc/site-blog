The Mars Phoenix Lander has been thwarted yet again in its attempts to scoop up Martian
soil into one of its lab instruments.  You might remember the previous occasion when the
<a href="/2008/06/stuck-dirt/">soil was too clumpy</a> to fall through the screen over the
instruments.  The same stickiness that made the soil clump together struck again in a
worse way, where the soil wouldn't even
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080728.html">drop from the
scoop</a>.

One crazy idea why the Martian soil got stuck on the scoop is because of the slime oozed
from Martian life.  Of course, realistically it's the half-melted water getting frozen on
the scoop, although there could be some other chemical phenomenon that is the cause.
While the researchers hoped to have analyzed a sample with water ice mixed in, they'll be
analyzing dry samples while they figure out how to get watery samples into the
instruments.  I hope a short circuit doesn't break the instruments before watery samples
can be analyzed.

This is yet another reason to send humans to Mars instead of just robots.  With a human
around, they could have just scraped off the dirt from the scoop, and we would probably
done the same amount of science that the Phoenix has done so far weeks ago.  I wish we had
something like a space elevator to make space exploration much cheaper.
