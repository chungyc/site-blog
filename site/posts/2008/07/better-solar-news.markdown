Via <a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/">DeSmogBlog</a>, I heard news that the <a href="http://www.blm.gov/">Bureau of Land Management</a> has <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/newsroom/2008/July/NR_07_02_2008.html">cancelled its plans</a> to impose a <a href="/2008/06/good-and-bad-solar-news/">moratorium on new solar plant proposals</a>.  Apparently public pressure does work on occasion.  Now if only Congress were to renew the tax credits for solar energy, we could see a surge of clean and renewable energy much faster than anticipated.

Hopefully we'll be able to see lower prices for oil and electric cars that are charged by renewable energy sources within several years.
