I have been thinking about sharing posts from this blog to Mastodon,
but I did not want to share them from my personal Mastodon account.
I would rather keep blog updates separate from content that
I toot directly to Mastodon.

A "sub-timeline" for my personal Mastodon account would work well enough
if they actually existed.  But they don't, so the next best thing is
to have a dedicated account for blog updates.
It turns out that <a href="https://rss-parrot.net/">RSS Parrot</a>
fits my needs perfectly here, where it provides a dedicated account
for an RSS feed with updates posted to the timeline and nothing else.

So the blog now has its own account at
[`@blog.chungyc.org@rss-parrot.net`](https://rss-parrot.net/web/feeds/blog.chungyc.org).
It is technically not a Mastodon account,
but the distinction is moot for the purpose of providing updates to Mastodon followers.
