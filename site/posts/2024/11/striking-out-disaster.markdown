One image which keeps coming up in my mind is a US president striking out an area with a sharpie on a forecasting map of an impending disaster, just because he misspoke and left out the area previously.  In fact, since he can't allow anyone to admit he made a mistake, federal aid would be withheld from the area once it's struck by disaster.

I wish this was a completely ridiculous notion.  Unfortunately, the next president of the US
has a history of [not admitting that he misspoke][sharpie-map] when he said that a state
was at risk when it was not.  He went as far as having someone draw a line on a hurricane
map with a sharpie to pretend he never misspoke, if he didn't draw it himself.  This was
relatively harmless (unfortunately, not completely harmless), but it weirded out a lot of people.

This person was also quite willing to [withhold federal aid][withheld-aid] from
states and territories he didn't like.  I shudder to think of what would happen
if he leaves out a state when warning of an impending disaster.

There are so many other things to worry about just based on what had happened before,
never mind what has been publicly stated about their plans if elected.
Some are even more important than this one, but this is the thing that keeps sticking in my head.
