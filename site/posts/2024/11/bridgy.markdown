In addition to [trying out RSS Parrot](/2024/11/rss-parrot/),
I am also trying out [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) to provide blog updates to Mastodon.

The account is [`@blog.chungyc.org@web.brid.gy`](https://fed.brid.gy/web/blog.chungyc.org).
I am going to compare between RSS Parrot and Bridgy Fed before settling down on one of these.
