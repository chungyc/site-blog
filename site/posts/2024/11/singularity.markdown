title: The singularity is not coming
description: I think diminishing returns will mean that the hypothesized runaway progress in intelligence known as the Singularity will not happen.

There is a concept called the [Singularity] which some think will happen in the near future.
The idea is that there will be artificial intelligences that will be able to create
smarter artificial intelligences, which in turn will create even smarter artifical intelligences,
ad infinitum, resulting in an exponential rate of change and advancement that
humans would have no chance of keeping up with.

I am one of those who are skeptical of this prediction.
It assumes that an intelligence can quickly create an intelligence greater than itself.
However, I suspect that increasing the same amount of intelligence, for whatever
definition of intelligence one chooses, will require far more effort the more
advanced the baseline intelligence is after some level.
For comparison, we have yet to create an intelligence that is as smart as us,
much less an intelligence that is smarter than us.

I would not be surprised if there are initial exponential advancements
in artifical intelligence, which in fact we may be in the middle of,
but I strongly suspect the rate of advancement will plateau at some point
and advance linearly at most instead of continuing exponentially with no end.
