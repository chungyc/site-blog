I knew that crows were smart, but I had no idea that they are so smart
that they could [hold grudges for over 15 years][crow-news].
Not only can an individual crow hold a grudge against specific people,
communication among crows is sophisticated enough that a group of them
can share who to be wary of and continue to harass them for over 15 years.

Not that I ever planned to be mean to crows,
but this is even more reason to be nice to them.
