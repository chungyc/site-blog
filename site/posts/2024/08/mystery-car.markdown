When recently renting a car, there was an option to rent a mystery car.
It was an option to rent an unspecified type of car that would be cheaper
than they would otherwise be.  It was suggested that it would be either
a hybrid or electric car, and that was exactly what I was hoping for.
However, what I got was a giant pickup truck, which as the polar opposite
of what I was hoping for.

This was disappointing.  It was a lesson for me to avoid mysteries.
