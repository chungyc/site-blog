The Ingenuity helicopter traveled to Mars with the Perseverance rover,
being the first vehicle to fly around in the atmosphere of another planet.
There was a little scare as contact with the helicopter was lost,
but communications were soon restored.
Unfortunately, damage was incurred on one of its rotors,
so [Ingenuity will no longer be flying].
This makes me a little sad, but not disappointed.
It was only supposed to be able to fly for three days,
so it has far exceeded its expectations.
