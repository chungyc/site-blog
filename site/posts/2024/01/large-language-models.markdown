Large language models such as [ChatGPT] and [Bard] have been all the rage lately.
After trying them out for a while, however,
I think the general hype around them may be a tad bit overdone.
The feeling I get is that they are _very_ good at stitching text seamlessly together,
but they do not actually _know_ anything.

There seems to a general feeling that the [Turing Test] is obsolete these days,
but as far as I am concerned, current levels of artificial intelligence
are not quite able to pass it yet.
Yes, there are humans who occasionally display similar levels of mechanical responses
through rote recitation of talking points, but I don't consider these
great displays of intelligence, so they would be the wrong target to compare against.
