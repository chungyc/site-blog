<h3>Comment policy</h3>
I have a basic policy of letting anyone say anything they want in the comments, as long as it pertains to the blog post's topic or other comments.  However, I reserve the right to moderate or remove anything I deem inappropriate.  Two types of comments that one can expect to be deleted with prejudice are spam and large-scale plagiarism.  On the other hand, short quotations used under fair use will usually be considered acceptable.
<h3>Privacy policy</h3>
<cite>Stochastic Scribbles</cite> relies on a number of third parties to function, from basic hosting to comments.  In addition, there may be the use of third-party cookies for serving advertisements and providing comments.  While I cannot absolutely guarantee that these third parties will not abuse anyone's privacy, I do think they can be trusted not to do so.  The third parties used by this blog are:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">DreamHost</a></li>
</ul>
As for myself, I do guarantee that I will not publicize anyone's email address nor any other private information contained in any personal correspondence with me without permission, nor will I expose non-public information of anyone who comments on the blog.  This guarantee does not apply to the <em>content</em> of any such personal correspondence or comment, however.
