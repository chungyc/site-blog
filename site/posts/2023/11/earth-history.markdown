Kurzgesagt has a great new video showing all of Earth history to scale.
It's a one hour video where every second shown is 1.5 million years passing for Earth.
It really makes it visceral how short human history is relative to all of Earth history.
I was also reminded how long multicellular life hadn't existed on Earth;
the eras before their emergence were not those that I paid much attention to.

This is now my favorite video for showing on idle screens.
