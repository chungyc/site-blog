To quote the [Second Amendment]:

> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,
> the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

The word "gun" does not appear at all, despite how frequently the amendment
is brought up in gun control debates.  It's about weapons in general for
a well-regulated militia.

In other words: We need to establish an NNWA (National Nuclear Weapons Association)
to expand our rights to possess a nuclear arsenal.
