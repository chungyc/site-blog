It looks like men mainly being the hunters and women mainly being the gatherers
in ancient times is an [incorrect stereotype].  This may have actually been
an academic conspiracy by men, given that there appears to be cherry-picking involved.
In fact, estrogen turns out to confer athletic benefits like testosterone does,
particularly in endurance, which turns out to be important for the somewhat
unique way humans hunt compared to other predators.

Sadly, this probably means that it's only a matter of time before
there is controversy over alleged estrogen doping.
