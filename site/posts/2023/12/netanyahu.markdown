Benjamin Netanyahu is rather unpopular in Israel.
Yet he is somehow the longest serving prime minister of Israel,
even as he becomes yet more unpopular with the [recent conflict between Hamas and Israel].
It mystifies me how he has remained prime minister for so long,
especially because Israel is not that much of an autocratic state.
At least not yet.
