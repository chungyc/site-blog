I picked up a copy of <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10539.html"><cite>The Cosmic Web</cite></a> by J. Richard Gott at a museum bookstore, as he was one of the authors of <a href="https://www.welcometotheuniverse.net/"><cite>Welcome to the Universe</cite></a>, which I enjoyed reading and studying.

It explains the history of how our modern understanding of large scale structures in the universe came about in a relatively accessible way.  If you have been mystified by how anyone could have figured out anything from the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background, as I have been, it goes a long way to demystifying how astrophysicists infer the amount of dark matter and dark energy in the universe based on the large-scale structure in the universe and the cosmic microwave background.

Going into a little more depth than what is usually written for the layperson, but not going so deeply that it would be incomprehensible to an interested layperson, I found this an enjoyable read.
