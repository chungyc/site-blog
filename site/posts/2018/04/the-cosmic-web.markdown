I picked up a copy of
<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10539.html"><cite>The Cosmic Web</cite></a>
by J. Richard Gott at a museum bookstore, as he was one of the authors of
<a href="https://www.welcometotheuniverse.net/"><cite>Welcome to the Universe</cite></a>,
which I enjoyed reading and studying.

It explains the history of how our modern understanding of large scale structures in the
universe came about in a relatively accessible way.  If you have been mystified by how
anyone could have figured out anything from the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave
background, as I have been, it goes a long way to demystifying how astrophysicists infer
the amount of dark matter and dark energy in the universe based on the large-scale
structure in the universe and the cosmic microwave background.

Going into a little more depth than what is usually written for the layperson, but not
going so deeply that it would be incomprehensible to an interested layperson, I found this
an enjoyable read.
