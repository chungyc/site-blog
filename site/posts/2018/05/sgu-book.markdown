<a href="https://www.theskepticsguide.org/">The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe</a>
is a podcast about skepticism I listen to religiously every week.
They have just written a book,
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6aNKDwAAQBAJ"><cite>The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe: How to Know What's Really Real in a World Increasingly Full of Fake</cite></a>.

<!--more-->

It seems like it would be a fun but useful overview of skeptical thinking
as a defense against magical thinking, somewhat in the same vein as the venerable
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yz8Y6KfXf9UC"><cite>The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</cite></a>,
except with a bit more wry humor that carries over from the podcast.
It's available for pre-order now, and while I can't say what the book will actually be like yet,
it's definitely on my pre-order list already.
