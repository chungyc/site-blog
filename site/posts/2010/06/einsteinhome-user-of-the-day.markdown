Today, I turn out to be the user of the day at
<a href="https://einsteinathome.org/">Einstein@Home</a>.
It might not amount to much, but I'm still getting all tingly inside.

If you happen to have idle CPU cycles left over on your computer,
consider contributing them to the cause of finding gravitational waves
or potential sources of gravitational waves at <a href="https://einsteinathome.org/">Einstein@Home</a>.
