The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/overview/index.html">Kepler
spacecraft</a> will observe the same patch of sky for years in an effort to discover
planets by the slight dimming as they pass in front of their parent stars.  Having been <a
href="/2009/03/kepler-launched/">launched</a> in March last year, it confirmed its ability
to detect planets by <a href="/2009/08/kepler-can-detect-planets/">detecting a known
planet</a> a few months later.

Now it has been announced that Kepler has <a
href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/kepler-5-exoplanets.html">discovered
five new planets</a>.  They are all large planets, one about the size of Neptune and the
others larger than Jupiter, that orbit very close to their parent stars with orbital
periods of only a few days and are extremely hot, with surface temperatures ranging from
1200 to 1600 degrees Celsius.  Since they orbit around their parent stars so quickly,
Kepler was able to observe the dimming of the light from the stars enough times that it
can be confirmed that they are indeed planets.  Discovering planets that are more like our
own Earth, with much longer orbital periods that last months or years, is going to take
many more years of observations.

There also seems to be an <a
href="https://www.starstryder.com/2010/01/04/kepler-first-science/">odd rumor</a> about
the observation of planet-like objects being hotter than their parent stars.  If they were
planets, then this shouldn't be possible.  Another possibility is that they are white
dwarfs, except they appear to be too big to be white dwarfs, either.  If this rumor
happens to be true and not some sort of miscommunication, then it looks like we are going
to learn something very surprising about white dwarfs or discover an entirely new type of
cosmic object out there.
