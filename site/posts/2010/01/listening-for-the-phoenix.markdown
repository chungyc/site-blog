The Mars Odyssey orbiter will be <a
href="https://www.universetoday.com/50350/odyssey-to-start-listening-for-phoenix-lander/">listening
for radio signals</a> from the Mars Phoenix Lander.  Having <a
href="/2008/11/a-farewell-to-phoenix/">ceased communications</a> near the end of 2008 with
the onset of the Martian winter, the Phoenix lander is extremely unlikely to have
survived, but if it somehow manages to come back to life with the start of the Martian
spring, it will be sending out signals that Odyssey should be able to pick up.  The
Phoenix lander was not designed to survive the Martian winter, so it would be extremely
impressive if Odyssey picks up signals from the lander: it really would be like a phoenix
in more ways than one (the other way being a resurrection of a cancelled Martian lander
project).

There most likely won't be any signals from the Phoenix lander, though, but this is still
an opportunity to remember the <a href="/2008/11/a-farewell-to-phoenix/">impressive
achievements</a> it made.
