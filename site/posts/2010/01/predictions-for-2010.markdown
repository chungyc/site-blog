Despite the fact that I am not psychic, I have this irresistible urge to make predictions for this year:

<ol>
<li>There will be a terrorist act somewhere in the world.  <span style="font-size:xx-small;">(Just as in every year during the last decade.)</span></li>
<li>A famous person will die.  <span style="font-size:xx-small;">(Just as in every year since forever.)</span></li>
<li>A U.S. politician will be implicated in a sex scandal, who will resign unless he is a Republican.</li>
<li>The Catholic Church will have to lose even more money over a legal settlement.</li>
<li>Someone will think they see Jesus, the Virgin Mary, or other holy figures.</li>
<li>An artificial black hole will not destroy the Earth, nor will we be turned into strange matter.</li>
<li>Dark energy will mostly remain a mystery, dark matter less so.</li>
<li>There will be less ice in the Arctic, Antarctica, and many other glaciers around the world.</li>
<li>The hit rate of these predictions will be higher than those for most self-proclaimed psychics.</li>
<li>I will still be blogging by the end of the year.</li>
</ol>

Like all predictions that have a nice chance of becoming true, they're pretty vague, and the chances are probably higher because they're based on extrapolation rather than a funny feeling in my head.
