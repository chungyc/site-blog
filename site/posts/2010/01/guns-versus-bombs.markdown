One thing that always occurs to me when there is a mass shooting is that they often don't
seem to be fundamentally different from suicide bombings.  In both types of events, the
perpetuator usually ends up killing and wounding a lot of people, and the perpetuator
almost always end up getting themselves killed, by getting themselves blown up, shooting
themselves, or getting shot by cops.  And yet, suicide bombings are invariably described
as terrorist acts while mass shootings are treated as 'merely' very tragic events (well,
except perhaps if the shooter is Muslim).  The one fundamental difference between a mass
shooting and a suicide bombing seems to be that there might be less property damage from
the former, even if in practice there might be different proportions of motives.

Not terribly important in the grand scheme of things, but the different perceptions have
been bugging me ...
