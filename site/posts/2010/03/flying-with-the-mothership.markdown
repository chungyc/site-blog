VSS Enterprise, aka WhiteKnightTwo and SpaceShipTwo attached together, succeeded in <a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/news/item/vss-enterprises-first-flight/">completing its first flight</a>.  The test flight only checked out that the mothership, WhiteKnightTwo, can fly properly while carrying the spaceship, SpaceShipTwo.  It did not test if SpaceShipTwo will detach properly from WhiteKnightTwo during actual flight.  Neither did it test out the rocket engine on SpaceShipTwo that will blast it into space.  And even if all the tests succeed without a glitch, SpaceShipTwo will only achieve suborbital flight, being unable to accelerate to a high enough speed to achieve orbit.  So the news is only interesting rather than exciting.

Still, it is a great first step towards suborbital space tourism, where reaching the boundaries of space would be a very expensive dream instead of a complete pipe dream to an ordinary person like myself.
