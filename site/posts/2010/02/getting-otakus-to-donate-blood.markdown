Only in Akihabara, Japan, the mecca for otaku who are crazy about all things anime and manga, could you see a <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/post/en/25416/Japan+Blood+Donation.html">heavily anime-themed blood donation facility</a>.  If I lived around a facility like that, I'd almost be tempted to give blood all the time (which is obviously the point).

This reminds me: I should be donating blood, anyway.  Not only as a good deed, but I need to be contributing more than enough blood in case I ever need some blood myself.  Now if I can just find the time to donate blood without having to worry about the lack of energy for the rest of the day ...
