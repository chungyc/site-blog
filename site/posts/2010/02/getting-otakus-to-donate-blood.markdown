Only in Akihabara, Japan, the mecca for otaku who are crazy about all things anime and
manga, could you see a
<a href="https://dannychoo.com/archive/en/posts/japan-blood-donation">heavily
anime-themed blood donation facility</a>.  If I lived around a facility like that, I'd
almost be tempted to give blood all the time (which is obviously the point).

This reminds me: I should be donating blood, anyway.  Not only as a good deed, but I need
to be contributing more than enough blood in case I ever need some blood myself.  Now if I
can just find the time to donate blood without having to worry about the lack of energy
for the rest of the day ...
