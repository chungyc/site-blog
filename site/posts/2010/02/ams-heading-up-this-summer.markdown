The International Space Station has been an enormously expensive structure in orbit that took over a decade to construct.  Despite the enormous expense, however, its scientific capabilities are somewhat lackluster.  So it's exciting to hear that the <a href="http://ams-02project.jsc.nasa.gov/">Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer</a>, a superconducting detector which can study cosmic rays, is <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2010/02/16/dark-matter-detector-heading-to-the-iss-this-summer/">heading to the ISS</a> in July.
