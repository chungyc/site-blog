With the installation of the cupola attached to the Tranquility module on the
International Space Station, I know what I will definitely be taking a look at if I ever
visit the space station.  (I can dream, can't I?)  With its much more open view compared
to the tiny viewports that were already on the space station, the cupola provides a
beautiful platform for looking outside at Earth or at space.

The view must be so impressive that even astronauts were gawking outside during the
ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Tranquility module and its cupola:
