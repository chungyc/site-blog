If you're anything like me, you'll be listening to <a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/">NPR Science Friday</a> every week (although not necessarily on Friday if you listen to it as a podcast like I do).  One of the funding sources for the radio program was the NSF; unfortunately, they've decided <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-fruchterman/science-friday-funding-cr_b_748607.html">not to continue their support</a>.  The NSF probably have their own valid reasons to stop their funding (like, there's a lot of pressure to cut the deficit, although I personally think that a public radio program promoting science would still be a very worthwhile cause to fund), but this means that Science Friday is facing financial difficulties.  And despite being an NPR program, it only gets 10% of its funding from NPR.  Fortunately, the program is in <a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/blog/2010/10/thank-you-for-your-support/">no immediate danger of going off the air</a>, but of course, they could use all the help they can get.

I love the show, so I support it.  If you're interested in science and have never been a listener of NPR Science Friday, then you might want to give it a listen.
