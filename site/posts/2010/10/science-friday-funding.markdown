If you're anything like me, you'll be listening to
<a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/">NPR Science Friday</a> every week (although not
necessarily on Friday if you listen to it as a podcast like I do).  One of the funding
sources for the radio program was the NSF; unfortunately, they've decided
<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/science-friday-funding-cr_b_748607">not to continue their support</a>.

The NSF probably have their own valid reasons to stop their funding (like, there's a lot
of pressure to cut the deficit, although I personally think that a public radio program
promoting science would still be a very worthwhile cause to fund), but this means that
Science Friday is facing financial difficulties.  And despite being an NPR program, it
only gets 10% of its funding from NPR.  Fortunately, the program is in no immediate danger
of going off the air, but of course, they could use all the help they can get.

I love the show, so I support it.  If you're interested in science and have never been a
listener of NPR Science Friday, then you might want to give it a listen.
