Without even having read the book, the blurb for the <cite>The Annunaki Enigma Armageddon 2010</cite> is enough to make me sure that it would quite a disaster.  I definitely would not have seen it if I weren't subscribed to the science fiction section at <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/">Fictionwise</a>, but the blurb was so much of a train wreck that it was hard to ignore:

The politicians have attempted to create a significant revenue source by correlating the warming theory to the burning of carbon-based fuels. A carbon tax is invented and those in power are pleased.

And this is only half of the blurb!  It <em>might</em> actually good if it were a satire, but it doesn't appear to be one.

Did he (or she) really think anyone would want to read the book after that blurb?
