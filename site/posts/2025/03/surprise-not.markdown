title: Trump is not good for peace
description: Some people are surprised that President Trump is not doing anything to help Gazans.  I just wonder what in his record would make them think that he would try anything to improve the situation.

I am flabbergasted that anyone would have thought that a Trump administration would
be sympathetic to the plight of Palestenians in Gaza and that they would even attempt
to achieve some level of peace in the region.

Did they seriously think that an openly racist presidential candidate would help the Gazans?
Were they hoping that his antisemitism would win out over his anti-Muslim and anti-Arab sentiments?
Have they missed the four years of Trump's previous term?
What in his previous term could have made them think that he would do
_anything_ to make _any_ situation more peaceful?
Did they truly think that Trump would be better for Gaza than the previous administration?

For those who did not support Trump, I can at least understand having a dim hope
that he _might_ do something to improve the situation, just because it's a different administration.
What I don't understand are those who supported Trump and are surprised with what is happening.
