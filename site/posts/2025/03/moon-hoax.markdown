Every so often I see someone who doubts the [Apollo moon landings] actually happened.
I get enormously angry at such people.
They are basically belittling the efforts of hundreds of thousands of people during the 1960s
for no other reason than to make themselves feel special.
They may _say_ that they are basing their opinions on evidence,
but the evidence they put forward are almost always so [laughably flimsy]
that I can only think they are being willfully ignorant.

The one doubt I can excuse are those wondering how we could have landed humans
on the moon in the 1960s when we haven't been back for decades.
Mainly because this involves ignorance of the budgets involved,
whereas other "evidence" cited involve actually learning something
but willfully not learning enough.

Apparently most people [think] that NASA has a budget much larger than it actually has,
and do not realize that the Apollo program used a higher percentage of
the US federal government's budget than NASA as a whole does today.
Throwing money at a problem can do wonders for making something happen,
of which NASA has not had the luxury for a long while.
