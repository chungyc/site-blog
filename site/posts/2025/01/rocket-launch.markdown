Yesterday's [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250105.html) fascinates me endlessly.
It is a time lapse video of a rocket launch in 2018 as taken from the International Space Station.
Not only is it not difficult to see the rocket itself as it rises above the atmosphere,
but you can also see the vehicle fire its thrusters while a spent rocket stage reenters the atmosphere.
