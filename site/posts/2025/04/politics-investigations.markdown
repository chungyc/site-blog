Democrats criminally investigate political opponents too little,
even for extremely serious crimes that should be investigated.
They are less hesitant to do so for political allies.

Republicans criminally investigate political oppenents too much,
even for things that have not happened and were completely made up.
They have to be dragged kicking and screaming to do so for political allies,
if they do so at all.

I have known this in some nebulous form about the US political establishment a long while,
but only today have I had the epiphany to make the comparison starkly.
These have frustrated and dissatisfied me since a long time ago,
but I have always thought about these separately and never together.

The [impending ruling] regarding the impeachment of the president
of South Korea had me thinking about how Donald Trump was not impeached
after January 6, 2021, and how investigations dragged on for four years
until they were made moot by him being elected president again.
Contrast this to South Korea, where Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached
almost immediately, and the judgement by the South Korean Constitutional Court
is going to happen less than five months after his attempted insurrection.
This led me to the realization of the stark contrast made above.

I am still uneasy about the impending ruling, though,
given how much the constitutional court is dragging with its ruling,
compared to previous rulings for presidents with much less serious and obvious crimes,
It reminds me of how the US Supreme Court dragged its feet on what
seemed to be an obvious issue, only to rule that the US president
is [not criminally liable] for any "official act".
At least I am pretty sure the announcement about the impending ruling
was not an April Fools' Day prank.
