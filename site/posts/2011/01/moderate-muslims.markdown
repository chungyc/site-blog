A common criticism against Islam is that there isn't enough condemnation from moderate Muslims when a fundamentalist Muslim does something terrible.  (The same sort of criticism can also be made against other religions, notably Christianity.)  In my opinion, it's raised a bit too often even when not justified, although sometimes it is, but there's at least one case where the criticism would definitely not apply: <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/murder_in_the_name_of_intolera.php">a Pakistani governor was murdered</a> by an extremist Muslim for opposing draconian blasphemy laws.

It won't matter if no moderate Muslim ever speaks up condemning this vile act, this is one case where the "moderate Muslims stay quiet" criticism would just earn a bop on the head from me, since it was precisely <em>because</em> he was a moderate Muslim speaking out that got Salman Taseer killed by an intolerant extremist.  I may not have agreed with his beliefs, but I respect him enormously for standing up against intolerance.  He should not have had to pay the ultimate price for it.
