The impossible has just happened.  The Star Wars movies are officially going to be made
available for digital download and online-only viewing from the usual digital movie retail
sites this Friday, including
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Star_Wars_The_Digital_Movie_Collection?id=sxvuhqcICJg">from the Google Play Store</a>.

I thought this day would never come, given what I've heard about George Lucas' opinion
about movies being made available without physical media, but I guess it was bound to
happen after Disney bought LucasFilm.

Disclaimer: I currently work for Google, although the reason for the link to the Google
Play Store is because that's what I use, and not because of where I work.
