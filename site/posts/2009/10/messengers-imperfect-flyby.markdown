The <a href="https://messenger.jhuapl.edu/">MESSENGER</a> spacecraft got the gravity
assist it needed from its <a href="/2009/09/messengers-third-flyby/">third flyby</a>, but
the flyby did not go perfectly.  Four minutes before its closest approach to the planet,
the spacecraft <a
href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/0930_messengers_third_gravity_assist">went into
safe mode</a> where only functions essential for the spacecraft's survival are left
active.  Taking pictures is not one of those functions, which means no images of Mercury
were taken when MESSENGER made its closest approach.

Fortunately, the MESSENGER spacecraft is fine now, and it still took plenty of images as
it approached Mercury.
