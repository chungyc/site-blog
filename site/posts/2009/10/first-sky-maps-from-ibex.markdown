<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ibex/index.html">IBEX</a>, the Interstellar
Boundary Explorer, studies the boundary between the heliosphere and the interstellar
medium by <a href="/2008/10/exploring-the-heliosphere-with-ibex/">observing energetic
neutral atoms</a> created as the solar wind hits interstellar gas.  They have just
released the first scientific results and associated sky maps from the data collected by
IBEX.  There's a surprise within the results: IBEX observed a ribbon around the
heliosphere that is a dense source of energetic neutral atoms, something that was
completely unpredicted by any of the theoretical models.  There also seems to be fine
structure within the ribbon, something else completely unpredicted and suggesting
something weird is going on in the boundary between the heliosphere and the interstellar
medium.

It is still unknown what the ribbon is, but the fact that it is suspiciously aligned with
the local galactic magnetic field might be a hint.  And it does not seem to be a screwup
with IBEX or due to a local source of energetic neutral atoms: the data from IBEX roughly
agrees with observations made by <a
href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/">Cassini</a>'s Ion and
Neutral Camera, which was primarily used to study Saturn's magnetosphere but also captured
data about the heliosphere.
