It is pretty well known that at gun shows in the United States there are often less than strict background checks when guns are sold (as in, none at all), and I was reminded about it when the New York City mayor prompted <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/nyregion/08guns.html">undercover video tapings of such transactions</a> to argue for stricter gun control.  Opposition to gun control is a favorite canard for those of right-wing political beliefs, but so is a vehement reaction to illegal immigration. 

This makes me wonder: for those who are both adamantly opposed to any gun control <em>and</em> want draconian measures enforced against illegal immigrants, would I get to see their heads explode when they're asked about an illegal immigrant trying to buy a gun at a gun show without any background checks?
