There's a common saying concerning the theory of special relativity:

<blockquote>
Relativity, causality, faster-than-light: pick any two.
</blockquote>

Paraphrasing this, here is the stochastic scribble of the day concerning any god:

<blockquote>
Omnipotent, omniscient, omni-benevolent, real: you can't have all four.
</blockquote>
