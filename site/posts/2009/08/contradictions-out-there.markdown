It's no surprise that politics make people say contradictory things in the same breath, but it feels like the cognitive dissonance is reaching epidemic levels these days.  Or maybe I'm just suffering Golden Age syndrome.  Here are some recent weird stuff said by people that gave me pause:

<ol>
<li>Torture is illegal.  We will not prosecute any high-level official from previous administration (who sanctioned torture).<!-- position of the Obama administraton --></li>
<li>I hate socialized medicine.  Leave my (government-run, socialized) Medicare alone. <!-- a townhall participant --></li>
<li>I don't want no bureaucrat determining my healthcare.  Leave the current system (where bureaucrats determine my healthcare) alone.<!-- too many sources --></li>
<li>The healthcare bill encourages living wills (through an amendment proposed by a Republican, where I could easily say to not disconnect the machines until I'm really, really dead), so it is a secret plot by Democrats to kill old people.<!-- too many sources --></li>
<li>We should not encourage development of alternative energy because people want cheap energy.  Remember the pain of $4 per gallon (non-alternative, carbon-emitting) oil?<!-- a guest on the Rachel Maddow show --></li>
<li>Socialism is bad for quality food production.  Monsanto (a huge agricultural corporation) is an example of such socialism.<!-- a guest on the Colbert Report --></li>
<li>I made a huge mistake.  But I should be forgiven and not resign, since God (who turns people into salt pillars for taking a peek, kicks out people because they took a bite out of a fruit, and burns people for eternity) is so forgiving.<!-- Mark Sanford --></li>
<li>I'm quitting.  It's because I'm not a quitter.<!-- Sarah Palin --></li>
<li>We need Hispanic votes.  I will vote against a Hispanic candidate because I have to blow out a minor comment all out of proportion.<!-- John McCain --></li>
<li>Why does he not show his birth certificate (which he already did last year) to me (whose birth certificate the public has never seen)?<!-- almost every birther and their sympathizers --></li>
</ol>
