<a href="http://firedoglake.com/2009/07/29/birthers-part-duex-republicans-divided/">Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri said</a>:

<blockquote cite="http://firedoglake.com/2009/07/29/birthers-part-duex-republicans-divided/">
What I don't know is why the President can't produce a birth certificate.  I don't know anybody else that can't produce one.  And I think that's a legitimate question.  No health records, no birth certificate ...

The "birther" conspiracy is a batshit crazy conspiracy theory that is getting far more attention than it deserves, and here Roy Blunt is saying something incredibly ironic to legitimize a fringe claim.  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=barack+obama+birth+certificate">Googling "Barack Obama birth certificate"</a> gives a <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/06/obama-birth.html">news article</a> right on the top which shows a copy of Barack Obama's birth certificate.  Compare this to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=roy+blunt+birth+certificate">googling "Roy Blunt birth certificate"</a>, which shows no sign of Roy Blunt's birth certificate for ten pages.  Is Roy Blunt an American citizen, much less a natural-born American?
