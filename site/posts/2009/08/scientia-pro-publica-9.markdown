I maintain <a href="http://sciencegossip.info/">Science Gossip</a>, which could be thought of as a newspaper covering science news with links to blog posts written by other people.  But if you prefer science magazines over science newspapers, covering not only science news but also including general articles on science with a slower release schedule, then the blog carnival <a href="http://scientiablogcarnival.blogspot.com/">Scientia Pro Publica</a> might be for you.

The <a href="http://pleion.blogspot.com/2009/08/scientia-pro-publica-9-with-twist.html">ninth edition of Scientia Pro Publica</a> is now up at <a href="http://pleion.blogspot.com/">Pleiotropy</a>.  I have the impression that there is much more blogging for biology than in other fields, and this is borne out in this edition of Scientia Pro Publica with articles about birds, maple seeds, sexual reproduction, and more.  Those who prefer more sterile sciences need not flee, as there are also articles about paintings, earthquakes, scientific literacy, etc.
