I knew the <a href="http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</a> would be good for something.  Not only did it <a href="http://blog.chungyc.org/2008/10/pulsing-with-gamma-rays/">discover the first pulsar that blinks only in gamma-rays</a> instead of the usual radio waves, it has <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/07/02/by-gamma-rays-alone-fermi-raises-the-curtain-on-16-new-pulsars/">discovered a total of 16 of them</a> so far, and not doubt it will discover many more.  And the gamma-ray telescope has not been in orbit for even a year yet!
