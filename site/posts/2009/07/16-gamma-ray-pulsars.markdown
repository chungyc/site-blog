I knew the <a href="https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</a>
would be good for something.  Not only did it <a
href="/2008/10/pulsing-with-gamma-rays/">discover the first pulsar that blinks only in
gamma-rays</a> instead of the usual radio waves, it has <a
href="https://www.universetoday.com/33864/by-gamma-rays-alone-fermi-raises-the-curtain-on-16-new-pulsars/">discovered
a total of 16 of them</a> so far, and not doubt it will discover many more.  And the
gamma-ray telescope has not been in orbit for even a year yet!
