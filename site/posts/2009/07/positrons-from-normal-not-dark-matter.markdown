The ESA space observatory <a
href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Integral_overview">Integral</a>
had observed gamma-rays from the center of the galaxy, which indicated the presence of
positrons distributed in a way that couldn't quite be explained with known phenomenon.
Hence some physicists speculated that the positrons may have been the <a
href="https://cerncourier.com/a/do-gamma-rays-indicate-galactic-dark-matter/">result of
dark matter annihilation</a>.  Not only did the distribution of positrons within our
galaxy <a
href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Integral/Integral_discovers_the_galaxy_s_antimatter_cloud_is_lopsided">turn
out to be lopsided</a>, arguing against dark matter annihilation as the source, but it has
now been explained how <a
href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090708201840.htm">supernovae could be
responsible</a> for the distribution of positrons.

Some had thought that supernovae could not be the source of most of the positrons because
it was assumed that they would all annihilate very close to their origin, which would not
match the observed distribution of positrons.  But it turns out that the positrons from
supernovae, which are the result of the decay of heavy elements from the stellar
explosion, travel nearly at the speed of light and can travel for thousands of light-years
before slowing down and annihilating with an electron.  By considering how electrons move
in galactic magnetic fields, they were able to model how positrons would travel before
being annihilated, and the results seem to be consistent with the Integral observations.

This deals a blow to the hypothesis that dark matter annihilation may be responsible for
the positron distribution.  I wonder if the same implication can be inferred for the
PAMELA observations<!-- defunct link:
