Using the change of radiation as Saturn's magnetic field rotates, the Voyager spacecraft
measured almost 30 years ago that a day of Saturn lasts 10 hours, 39 minutes, and 24
seconds.  However, the same measurements by the Cassini spacecraft suggests that it lasts
10 hours, 47 minutes, and 6 seconds, over seven minutes longer.  Such a significant change
in the bulk rotation rate of Saturn probably means that Saturn's magnetic field does not
quite rotate in lockstep with the planet itself.  Another method might be needed to
measure the length of a Saturnian day.

Another way to measure the rotation rate of Saturn has been proposed using an <a
href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090729145728.htm">analysis of its
winds</a>.  Applying this analysis to Jupiter gives a length of day close to what is
known, so it might be a better way to measure the length of a Saturnian day than using
magnetic fields.  The analysis suggests that a day of Saturn lasts 10 hours, 34 minutes,
and 13 seconds with an estimated error of 20 seconds, which is five minutes shorter than
that measured by the Voyager spacecraft.  This is also closer to the value of 10 hours, 32
minutes, and 35 seconds derived from measurements of Saturn's gravity field by the Cassini
spacecraft.

While a five minute difference might not seem much, the difference means about a 300
kilometer per second difference for the estimated equatorial wind speeds on Saturn.  That
is a <em>big</em> difference in wind speeds, and the new estimated length of day for
Saturn brings its weather system more in line with Jupiter's, where eastward and westward
winds have about the same speed.
