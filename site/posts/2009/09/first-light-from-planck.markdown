The Planck spacecraft <a href="http://blog.chungyc.org/2009/05/launch-of-herschel-and-planck/">launched in May</a> will give us much more detailed maps of the cosmic microwave background than ever before.  So it is good news that <a href="http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM5CMFWNZF_index_0.html">its first light survey</a> over a narrow strip through the sky indicates that its instruments are all working very well.  The first light survey would probably not give us any exiting scientific results, but its success bodes well for its future.  We could be looking towards tremendous discoveries in cosmology after the end of 2012, which is when Planck's data from the cosmic microwave background will be released.
