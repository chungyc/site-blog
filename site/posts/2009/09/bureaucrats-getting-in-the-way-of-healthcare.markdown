Via <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/09/i_am_one_pissed_off_mfker.php">Greg Laden's Blog</a>, this is what happens when corporate bureaucrats get between people and healthcare <em>right now</em> in the United States:

An apathetic government bureaucrat might not be ideal, but this has <em>got</em> to be better than the way it currently is in the United States, where a corporate bureaucrat <em>wants</em> to deny you healthcare even after you have paid health insurance premiums for years.  And this is assuming that a corporate bureaucrat allows you to get health insurance in the first place.
