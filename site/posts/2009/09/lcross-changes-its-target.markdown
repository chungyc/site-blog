<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LCROSS/main/index.html">LCROSS</a> was going
to <a href="/2009/09/impact-site-for-lcross/">crash into crater Cabeus A</a>.  But after
analyzing data from spacecraft such as the LRO, the Lunar Prospector, Chandrayaan-1, and
Kaguya, the impact site for LCROSS has been changed to Cabeus (proper), a bigger crater
close to Cabeus A.  This determination was made because the hydrogen content and terrain
suggests that crashing into Cabeus rather than into its satellite crater would give the
best chance of observing water in the resulting plume.
