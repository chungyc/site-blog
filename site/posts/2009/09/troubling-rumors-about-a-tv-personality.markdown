There are troubling rumors that a certain TV talk show host <a href="http://didglennbeckrapeandmurderayounggirlin1990.com/">raped and murdered a young girl in 1990</a>.  <!-- backup sites: http://gb1990.com/ http://gb1990.net/ -->  I do not believe this to be true, but the lack of response concerning the matter from said talk show host is disturbing.  If he did not commit these horrendous crimes, then why will he not deny these allegations?  Is it possible that these rumors are actually true?

...  I'm not sure why, but there seems to be something horribly wrong with this way of thinking.  But said talk show host argues like this all the time, so this line of thinking has to have something to it, right?  It can't be the case that a famous person that has his own television show talks nonsense on a regular basis, can it?
