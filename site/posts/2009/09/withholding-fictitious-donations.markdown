<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/">Pharyngula</a> mentions that certain people <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/09/repercussions.php">claimed to have withheld million dollar donations</a> to the University of Minnesota, Morris because PZ Myers <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/the_great_desecration.php">desecrated a cracker</a> (amongst other things).  Adding up all the claims would suggest that the university would not get any donations this year.  Surprise, surprise, donations to the university actually went <em>up</em> this year.  <em>Maybe</em> there was a single person who actually withheld their planned million dollar donation to the University of Minnesota, Morris, but there is no way all of the claims were serious.

Maybe I should tell certain churches that I had planned to donate millions of dollars to them, but I changed my mind because they were religious, intolerant, hateful, homophobic, etc.  Unlikely to have any effect, I know: just look at how well the tactic worked on PZ Myers and the University of Minnesota, Morris.  Then again, if a church can believe that someone sacrificed himself to himself to save people from damnation that he himself administers ...
