By now, you probably all know that the <a
href="https://www.universetoday.com/39639/just-how-good-is-the-new-hubble-lets-compare/">Hubble
Space Telescope is back in business</a> after its repairs in May.  (Notwithstanding its <a
href="https://slate.com/technology/2009/07/hubble-pix-at-jupiter-s-scar.html">imaging of
the Jupiter impact</a> in July, which was done by taking time out of its calibration
phase.)  The repairs did not merely replace aging instruments, but replaced them with
<em>better</em> instruments incorporating advances in technology.  It shows, with recently
released images revealing more details than ever before.  And what's more is that each
image requires a lot less time to be taken, which means more observations can be done by
Hubble.

As an example of how much the Hubble Space Telescope has improved, compare images of NGC
6302, the Butterfly Nebula, taken before and after the repairs.
