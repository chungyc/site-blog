The first collision of two major man-made objects has occurred in Earth orbit, with <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/02/11/two-satellites-collide-in-earth-orbit/">an Iridium satellite colliding with a Russian satellite</a>.  While the size of the objects in the collision might not be much compared to some of the major collisions that occur on the ground, the high speeds necessary for orbits makes these collisions much more energetic.  Let's just hope that the problem doesn't get too much worse, where a <a href="http://www.aip.org/isns/reports/2008/014.html">chain reaction</a> of collisions creating lots of space debris that in turn collide with other satellites occur.
