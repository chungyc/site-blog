It's common computer folklore that <a
href="https://blog.robertelder.org/causes-of-bit-flips-in-computer-memory/">cosmic rays
cause errors in computer chips</a>.  This is not actually true, or at least it is so rare
that a cosmic ray actually manages to reach the ground and knock out a bit in a computer
chip, that it might not as well happen compared to the far more common occurrence of an
alpha particle emitted by ordinary materials causing errors in computer chips.

So it's rather a surprise that the Mars Rover Opportunity suffered a problem because <a
href="https://www.universetoday.com/24717/opportunity-rover-sidelined-by-charged-particle-hit/">it
may have been hit by a cosmic ray</a>.  What is even more impressive is that the hardware
in the rover could detect such problems.  It's a testament to how robust its systems were
designed to be.
