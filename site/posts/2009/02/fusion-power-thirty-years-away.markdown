Economical power generation through fusion has always been "thirty years away", but this time it feels like it <em>really</em> may be <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7891787.stm">just thirty years away</a>.  With machines such as <a href="http://www.iter.org/">ITER</a>, the <a href="http://zpinch.sandia.gov/">Z Machine</a>, and the <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/">National Ignition Facility</a>, which may be able to far surpass the break-even point, where more energy is produced by fusion than is put into the machines, the prospects look pretty good for commercial fusion power in the foreseeable future.  Even <a href="http://www.fusor.net/files/EMC2_FusionToPost.pdf">inertial electrostatic confinement</a>, which works by smashing accelerated particles instead of heating them to unimaginable temperatures as in the more mainstream approaches, seems promising as a source for fusion power generation, with showstopper flaws apparently having been solved recently.

It's a pity that <a href="http://slamlander.caselle-vpn.net/?p=1279">fusion research has been chronically underfunded</a>, though, given how expensive the research is but with the huge potential payoffs.  Ironically, this is also the reason why it's <a href="http://iecfusiontech.blogspot.com/2007/11/holding-back-fusion.html">so much harder</a> to pursue promising approaches that could be much cheaper than the mainstream approaches.
