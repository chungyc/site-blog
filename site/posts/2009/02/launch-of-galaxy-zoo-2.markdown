The new and improved version of <a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org/">Galaxy Zoo</a> has just been <a href="http://www.galaxyzooblog.org/2009/02/16/zoo-2-launches/">launched</a>!  You can yet again look at pretty pictures of galaxies, and even more importantly, you can contribute to actual science by inspecting the galaxies and classifying them according to a small set of features.  With more features to classify and a higher rate of pretty galaxies to look at, it looks like it's going to be an even better experience than with the original Galaxy Zoo, not to mention the better science that could result.
