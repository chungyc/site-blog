From a little tidbit by an interested informer, I got to learn about someone wondering if
the measured distances of stars and galaxies are really applicable
<a href="https://absenceofgood.blogspot.com/2009/02/much-older-universe.html">when it
takes so long for their light to reach us</a>, that their actual distances <em>now</em>
could be completely different.  It is actually a bit mind-bending to think about all the
issues, which happen to be the sort of thing I love to think and explain, except my
explanation was getting rather long for a comment.

For relatively close objects (the Andromeda galaxy would count as relatively close in this
context!), the notion of a distance is pretty clearcut.  The observed distances should
pretty much be the distances <em>now</em>, unless we're missing something drastic that has
happened in the meantime.  So for Alpha Centauri, whose light took about four years to
reach us, it should <em>still</em> be about four light-years away, especially since it's
been that way four years ago, and the same way four years before that, ad semi-infinitum.
It's certainly possible, although <em>very, very</em> unlikely, that it might not be four
light-years away <em>now</em>, perhaps because of a close encounter with an unseen star or
even dense clumps of dark matter, or it might not even be there anymore as a victim of a
<a href="https://nightsdawn.fandom.com/wiki/Neutronium_Alchemist">Neutronium Alchemist</a>.
But fanciful speculations aside, there's no reason to think that Alpha Centauri would not
be four light-years away <em>now</em>.

Even the Andromeda Galaxy, which is about 2.5 million light-years away, would pretty much
be 2.5 million light-years away <em>now</em> despite the light having taken 2.5 million
years to reach us.  We have a pretty good idea of how gravity works, and with the closest
object that could affect the galaxy's movement significantly being our own Milky Way
Galaxy, it's pretty certain that it is even now approaching our galaxy at a steady 300
kilometers per second.  Unless
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeelee_Sequence">photino birds</a> have flung the
Andromeda Galaxy, or even our own galaxy, as a giant projectile weapon against a million
light-year wide artifact ...

Things get messy for objects that are <em>really</em> far out.  I'm pretty sure that in
most cases astronomers refer to distances by how far the light had to travel.  However,
this is <em>only</em> the distance that the light itself had traveled.  We can also think
about the actual distances to an object when the light was emitted and when we received
the light.  Because of the expansion of the universe, the distance between two objects
grows as light travels between them.  This is not much of an issue for objects that are
relatively close since the space between them expands only a little compared to the
distance between them, but the changes are rather large for objects that are very distant
on a cosmological scale.

For example, between the Milky Way Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy which are a mere 2.5
million light-years apart, the expansion of space will increase the distance between the
galaxies by less than 10,000 light-years in 2.5 million years, so it would <em>still</em>
be about 2.5 million light-years apart even if the expansion of space were to be taken
into account.  (In reality, this is more than canceled out by the movement between the two
galaxies due to the gravitational attraction.)  In contrast, something that is 10 billion
light-years away from us in terms of how far the light had to travel was actually about 6
billion light-years away when the light was emitted while it would be about 16 billion
light-years away right now, assuming nothing drastic happened to the thing in the
meantime.

But even this glosses over some thorny issues.  What do distances <em>then</em> and
<em>now</em> really mean?  And are they really meaningful?  There isn't going to be any
measuring tape in the universe which can measure distances of billions of light-years, and
the expansion of space means that a most suitable measure for short distances, the travel
time of light, is no longer the unambiguously clear distance measure it could be.  There
can be alternate ways to measure a distance at a specific time such as having observers
about every million light-years apart, waiting until the universe has aged some exact
amount of time, say by agreeing to wait until the redshift of the cosmic microwave
background is some specific value, then measuring the distances between the closest
observers and signaling the measurements among each other, which could all be added up to
be the distance at some specific time during the life of the universe.  It would take
billions of years, but it could work.

Obviously, this is <em>way</em> beyond practical for us puny humans, so we have to infer
the distance just from the light that arrives at Earth.  But while we could still do a
reasonable job of measuring how far the light must have traveled using
<a href="https://universe-review.ca/R02-07-candle.htm">standard candles</a>, inferring the
distances then and now depends on how well we can model the universe.  But even if we can
<a href="https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html">compute these distances</a>
accurately, which we can do a much better job of thanks to data from
<a href="https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/">WMAP</a> (although I still have little idea of how the
fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background are supposed to help), the distances then
and now may not be the best ways to express how far distant cosmological objects are.

The problem with the "current" distance is that what we see of a distant cosmological
object is what it was a long time ago, not what it is now.  For a quasar that is about 10
billion light-years away in terms of light travel distance, the object would now be at
about 17 billion light-years away.  But the problem is that the object is by now a very
different object than when it was a quasar.  In fact, it would almost certainly be an
ordinary neighborhood galaxy by now.  It would be kind of awkward to say that the quasar
is 17 billion light-years away when it was <em>not</em> 17 billion light-years away during
the time it was a quasar, while it is no longer a quasar now when it really <em>is</em> 17
billion light-years away.

The "old" distance, the distance to the object when the light was emitted, is even more
problematic.  Space had not expanded as much when the universe was young so that
everything was that much closer.  In fact, depending on when the light was emitted, the
distance to the object could have actually been smaller at the time despite the light
traveling even greater distances.  For an object about 13 billion light-years away in
terms of light travel distance, it could have really been about 3 billion light-years away
at the time the light was emitted.  Meanwhile, an object about 8 billion light-years away
could have really been about 5 billion light-years away at the time the light was emitted.
An object that was closer when it emitted the light can actually be farther away!

And I'm not even going into the
<a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/redshift.html">fundamentally different ways</a>
that distance could be defined over cosmological scales, not to mention what "then" and
"now" might really mean in our relativistic universe.  Given all the ambiguity and
uncertainties, astronomers much prefer to express distances to distant cosmological
objects with something they can directly measure, the redshift of the spectrum.
Unfortunately for most ordinary people, it might not mean much that the redshift is 0.1,
1.0, or 10, so we usually get distances in terms of
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part8/section-14.html">how far the light
travelled</a>.  One billion, 8 billion, or 13 billion light-years are somewhat more
comprehensible to a layperson like me, which I usually accept without much thought.  But I
get a headache when I <em>really</em> think about all the issues that surround
cosmological distances.
