Senate Democrats have promised to prevent detainees in the GuantÃ¡namo Bay facility from
being transferred to prisons within the US.  The ostensible reason is that they do not
want the detainees to be released within the United States, which is patently ridiculous
on its face: there is no way they could confuse transfer of prisoners to another detention
facility with releasing them.  There has <em>got</em> to be another reason.

In fact, I can think of <em>two</em> possible reasons.  One is that Senate Democrats are
very soft on terrorism: it would be very hard on alleged terrorists to be detained along
with other violent and psychopathic criminals.  How long do you think an alleged terrorist
would last inside a maximum security prison?  For that matter, Republicans must also be
worried enormously about the safety of the alleged terrorists, given the same "not in my
backyard" responses.

Or maybe Senate Democrats have something entirely different in mind: if the detainees
can't be moved to the United States or any other country in the world, where can they be
moved to?  The answer should be pretty obvious: space!  They must be taking a leaf from
Britain and Australia, and they must be planning to ship them to a colony in orbit, the
Moon, or even Mars.  The prospect of a space colony really excites me, even if it is going
to be filled with the psychopathic or the very unlucky rather than the best and the
brightest.
