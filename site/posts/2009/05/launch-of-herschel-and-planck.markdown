The Herschel and Planck spacecraft have been <a
href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/05/14/herschel-and-planck-launch-succesfully/">successfully
launched from the same rocket</a>.  <a
href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel_overview">Herschel</a>
is the largest infrared and submillimeter space telescope to date and is intended to
observe the far infrared portion of the cosmic background, which should reveal details of
how galaxies and stars formed in the earliest periods of the universe.  <a
href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Planck">Planck</a> will
observe the cosmic microwave background in unprecedented detail, which will let us check
out several theories for the origin of the universe such as how inflation may have
occurred or the shape of our universe.

It's great to see the successful launch of two spacecraft that will both study the early
universe.  Given that <em>two</em> spacecraft depended on this successful launch by the <a
href="https://www.esa.int/">ESA</a>, it's a huge relief.
