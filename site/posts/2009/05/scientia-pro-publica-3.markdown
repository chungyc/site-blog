If you like reading science blog posts written for public consumption, you might be interested in the third edition of the <a href="http://network.nature.com/people/boboh/blog/2009/05/04/scientia-pro-publica-3-the-swine-flu-edition">Scientia Pro Publica</a> blog carnival.  Given all the current attention to the swine flu, it's no surprise that this edition has a special section just for it, although I also have a vested interest in promoting the blog carnival since it includes my explanation of the potential confusion when referring to <a href="http://blog.chungyc.org/2009/02/cosmological-distances/">cosmological distances</a>.
