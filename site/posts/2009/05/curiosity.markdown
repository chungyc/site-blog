Curiosity may have killed the cat, but hopefully it won't kill itself.  The <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/">Mars Science Laboratory</a>, the car-sized rover that will eventually become the largest one sent to Mars, has just been <a href="http://twitter.com/MarsScienceLab/status/1936037287">renamed "Curiosity"</a>.  Congratulations to 6th grade student Clara Ma for suggesting the winning name!
