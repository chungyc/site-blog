Curiosity may have killed the cat, but hopefully it won't kill itself.  The <a
href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/">Mars Science Laboratory</a>, the car-sized rover
that will eventually become the largest one sent to Mars, has just been renamed
"Curiosity".  Congratulations to 6th grade student Clara Ma for suggesting the winning
name!
