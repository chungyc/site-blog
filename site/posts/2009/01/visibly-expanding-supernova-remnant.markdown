I get a tingly feeling when I see cosmic objects change within our lifetimes.  It's no
exception when I learn about a <a
href="https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/casa/">video from the Chandra X-ray
observatory</a> that shows how the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant expanded over a seven
year period via <a

The supernova remnant is about 10 light years across, and despite its unimaginable size,
it's growing visibly in a few scant years.  It is expanding at about 11 million miles per
hour, which is about 1.6% of the speed of light.  For comparison, this is about a hundred
times faster than the <a
href="https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/fastest_spacecraft.html">fastest
spacecraft</a>, which in turn is about a thousand times faster than an average car.
Astronomers are a greedy bunch, however.  Despite the staggering speed of 1.6% the speed
of light, they <em>still</em> think it's too slow.  Fortunately, they have a good
explanation for why it's slower than expected: a lot of the energy from the supernova is
lost in the form of cosmic rays.

I think my math skills have deteriorated to an alarming degree, though: With an image
scale of 8.4 arcminutes and a distance of 10,000 light-years as specified on the <a
href="https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/casa/">Chandra page</a>, the supernova
remnant should be about 20 to 25 light-years across, and yet <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_A">Wikipedia</a> and other sources all say
it's ten light-years across.  The discrepancy is too large even when taking the margins
into account.  Maybe there's some unspecified cropping that has been done ...
