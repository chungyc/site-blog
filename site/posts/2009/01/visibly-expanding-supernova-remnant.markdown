I get a tingly feeling when I see cosmic objects change within our lifetimes.  It's no exception when I learn about a <a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/casa/">video from the Chandra X-ray observatory</a> that shows how the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant expanded over a seven year period via <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/06/aas-4-supernova-expands-as-we-watch/">Bad Astronomy</a>.

The supernova remnant is about 10 light years across, and despite its unimaginable size, it's growing visibly in a few scant years.  It is expanding at about 11 million miles per hour, which is about 1.6% of the speed of light.  For comparison, this is about a hundred times faster than the <a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/fastest_spacecraft.html">fastest spacecraft</a>, which in turn is about a thousand times faster than an average car.  Astronomers are a greedy bunch, however.  Despite the staggering speed of 1.6% the speed of light, they <em>still</em> think it's too slow.  Fortunately, they have a good explanation for why it's slower than expected: a lot of the energy from the supernova is lost in the form of cosmic rays.

I think my math skills have deteriorated to an alarming degree, though: With an image scale of 8.4 arcminutes and a distance of 10,000 light-years as specified on the <a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/casa/">Chandra page</a>, the supernova remnant should be about 20 to 25 light-years across, and yet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_A">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://www.skyimagelab.com/cassuprem.html">other sources</a> all say it's ten light-years across.  The discrepancy is too large even when taking the margins into account.  Maybe there's some unspecified cropping that has been done ...
