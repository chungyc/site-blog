There is a lot of drama stemming from Governor Blagojevich's surprise appointment of Roland Burris to the Senate, with Burris steadfastly maintaining that it's a valid appointment and Senate Democrats condemning it.  Not to mention the Illinois secretary of state refusing to certify the appointment, which gave the Senate an excuse to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99063478">chase Burris away</a>.  I can understand the perspectives from both Burris and the Senate Democrats.  This might be the best chance for Roland Burris to become part of the Senate, having had a bad track record with some previous elections, and I haven't heard anything about Burris himself that would disqualify him.  On the other hand, the Senate would not be happy about a member being appointed by an allegedly very corrupt governor, as they wouldn't want to be dogged by allegations of one of their own members being appointed in a corrupt process.

However the vacant Illinois Senate seat turns out, though, what really has me scratching my head are Blagojevich's intentions.  I have absolutely no idea what the governor was trying to accomplish with the appointment.  Given the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/us/politics/09text-illinois.html">wiretap transcripts</a> of his phone conversations, it's a little hard to believe that he did it purely for the good of the state of Illinois, but who knows?  Or maybe he just wanted to snub everyone who was trying to find another way to appoint a senator.  Perhaps he knew the political turmoil the appointment would cause and did it to take revenge on everyone else.  To go into even more cynical and conspiratorial speculations, there could even have been some sort of shady deal between Blagojevich and Burris besides the $14,000 political contribution the latter made to the former, as $14,000 hardly seems to be worth a corrupt appointment.

I just can't guess which possibility is the most likely.  In fact, none of them seem to be especially probable.  And there doesn't seem to be much talk wondering about what Blagojevich's motivations are.  I guess I'll just have to put it out of my mind.
