As proof that the Bush administration has not been the worst possible presidential administration conceivable, following the <a href="/2009/01/good-and-bad-news-about-nuclear-iran/">news concerning Iran</a>, there are in fact countries around the world that are <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7821449.stm">quite appreciative of President Bush</a>.  His foreign policy has not been a <em>complete</em> disaster (although arguably still quite a disaster), as Israel and Kosovo appreciate the support that they got from the Bush administration.  The president also has an 80% approval rating in Africa, thanks to increased economic aid and his perceived role in reducing conflict within the continent.

While opinions from Israel and Kosovo are not really much of a surprise, the high regard that much of Africa has for the Bush administration is very much one.  Regardless of whether the high regards are justified or not, this should be a reminder to myself that no matter how hard the Bush administration has tried to (unintentionally) portray itself as a cartoon evil, they're still a group of human beings who are capable of doing at least some things right.  Then again, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-ed-bush13-2009jan13,0,4647438.story">Bush's self-congratulatory and denial-filled final press conference as president</a> makes me wonder that it's not for the lack of trying that the Bush administration is not pure cartoon evil ...
