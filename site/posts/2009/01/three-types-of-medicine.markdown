Stochastic scribble of the day:

<blockquote>
There are only three types of medicine: medicine that have been shown to work, medicine that has yet to be tested, and medicine that have failed to show any efficacy.  Mainstream medicine only really cares about the first category; there's a reason why most complementary and alternative "medicine" is not mainstream.
