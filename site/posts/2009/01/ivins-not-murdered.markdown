While I never believed that Dr. Ivins, the main suspect for the <a href="http://blog.chungyc.org/2008/09/apparent-flimsiness-of-anthrax-case/">2001 anthrax attacks</a>, was murdered in a way to look like suicide so as to shut him up or set him up as a patsy, it did make me <a href="http://blog.chungyc.org/2008/09/ivins-deduced-the-anthrax-attacker/">wonder a tiny bit</a>.  But such suspicions have been put to rest due to reports that Dr. Ivins <a href="http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/news/displayUpdate.htm?StoryID=84753"><em>wanted</em> to die</a>, given the way he explicitly said so in the hospital and tried to remove his tubes.

Of course, it's still possible that the report itself could be a fabrication or that he was somehow blackmailed into suicide, but for better or worse, I'm not <em>that</em> paranoid.
