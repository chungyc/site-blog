Magnetars are apparent neutron stars with <em>incredibly</em> strong magnetic fields.
Their magnetic fields are hundreds or thousands of times stronger than those even of
pulsars, which are rotating neutron stars that have extremely strong magnetic fields
themselves.  The incredibly strong magnetic fields of magnetars powers beams of X-rays and
gamma-rays, which make the radio beams of pulsars seem weak in comparison.

<a href="/2008/06/quark-stars-from-stellar-explosion-remnants/">Quark stars</a>, on the
other hand, are heavy balls of ordinary matter where even neutron degeneracy pressure is
not enough to keep them neutron stars.  With the enormous pressures, neutrons break apart
into their constituent quarks to form a quark star.  Unlike neutron stars, the existence
of quark stars is not as firmly established, although the evidence for their existence
both through observations and theoretical models seems to get stronger all the time.

Computer simulations by Canadian researchers suggest that the best explanation for
magnetars is that <a
href="https://www.universetoday.com/23327/could-quark-stars-explain-magnetars-strong-magnetic-field/">they
may in fact be quark stars</a>.  Their simulations show that in a quark star, the quarks
pair up to form Cooper pairs as they go into a color-flavor locked phase, which can give
rise to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-th/0304005">color ferromagnetism</a> and
generate a tremendously powerful magnetic field.  Cooper pairs are the basis for
superconductivity and superfluidity in ultra-cold metals and helium, and likewise the
color-flavor locked quarks form a superfluid inside the quark star.

The core of at least some neutron stars also probably form a superfluid, as one of the
properties of a superfluid is that it can only rotate at discrete speeds, which shows up
as "glitches" in the period of a pulsar.  What blows my mind is the formation of
superfluids in neutron stars and quark stars: it boggles the mind to think of matter
flowing with absolutely no resistance at all under high pressures that are beyond
imagination.  And it might be responsible for the high magnetic fields of a magnetar.

The computer simulations also suggest that it might take days to thousands of years for a
heavy enough neutron star to turn into a quark star after a supernova, presumably after
the thermal activity of the neutrons cool off so that the heat would no longer help prop
up the neutron star.  And given that less than 5% of the mass of a neutron is due to its
constituent quarks, with the rest from the binding energy between the quarks and their
kinetic energy, the transition from a neutron star to a quark star should release
<em>humongous</em> amounts of energy as a significant portion of the neutron star's mass
turns into pure energy.  It might even dwarf the energy released in a supernova.

This is another thing to boggle the mind: something only tens of kilometers across could
release energy comparable or even larger than what a star millions of kilometers across
could release as it implodes during a supernova.
