The <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2009/01/01/international/i010248S92.DTL">full-blown attack of the Gaza strip by Israel</a> is like the state of Oregon staging a full-scale military attack with their National Guard units against Salem for its <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/12/15/oregon.bank.bomb/">bank bombings</a>, if Salem was an autonomous region instead of the capital of Oregon.  While Israel would be fully justified in doing <em>something</em> in response to the rocket attacks from the Gaza strip, this particular response seems to be a huge overreaction.

The funny thing, if such things can be funny, is that Israel's actions end up proving those responsible for the rocket attacks right, just as those responsible for the rocket attacks end up justifying Israel's actions.  Perhaps the leadership of Israel and Hamas <em>want</em> the other side to inflict as much damage as possible on their own side so they get the justification to wreak as much havoc as they want on the other side.  Whatever the case may actually be, it certainly <em>feels</em> like the leadership of both sides have wanted violence for a <em>long time</em>.

What makes things worse is that I'm not sure if there really is <em>anything</em> that Israel could do to promote peace, although the current military attack certainly feels like it would just make things worse.
