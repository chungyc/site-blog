The Bush administration has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/11/washington/11iran.html">refrained from any attempt to overtly attack Iran's nuclear facilities</a> and have managed to hold back Israel from doing the same.  This is the good news: despite how much the Bush administration has sucked, this shows they still retain a shred of sanity and are not the worst possible administration conceivable.  The bad news is that knowledge of a covert operation against Iran's nuclear program is in the news.  If there is any such operation, and if Iran really does have future nuclear weapons in mind even if they have suspended development on a warhead itself, I really don't think that even revealing the existence of such an operation would be a good thing.
