Like <a href="http://www.atheistrev.com/2008/12/obamas-warren-pick-not-big-deal.html">many other people</a>, I'm not happy about the invitation of Rick Warren to give the invocation at Barack Obama's presidential inauguration.  Never mind the more general unease of giving a religious oath for government office, which I think is wrong but will grudgingly accept for the sake of tradition, but Rick Warren has been very active in opposing civil rights for homosexuals.  It's one thing to oppose the granting of rights to a minority group, which is bad enough, but it's a disgrace to take rights <em>away</em>.  In fact, it's a disgrace that a majority of Californian voters decided to take away rights by <a href="http://www.stateofprotest.com/blog/morality/erasing-decades-of-moral-progress-with-proposition-8/">approving Proposition 8</a>.  Anyways, it's troubling that Barack Obama would give someone like Rick Warren a central role in his inauguration.

I'm going to take a wait and see attitude to the invitation before I ultimately determine how to think about the whole affair, though.  I'm <em>really</em> hoping that Obama is doing this to throw a huge symbolic bone to the religious right so that he wouldn't have to offer substantive bones, in which case <em>of course</em> he wouldn't be able to explain his real reasons for inviting Rick Warren.  However, this is really just wishful thinking, so I still consider efforts <a href="http://www.atheistrev.com/2008/12/ask-obama-to-uninvite-bigot-rick-warren.html">to have Rick Warren uninvited</a> to be worthy causes, even if I wouldn't personally participate.
