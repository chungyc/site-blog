dust has been found</a> in sediments across North America from 13,000 years ago.  It's not
much of a find in terms of riches: rather, it's an indication of what may have happened
13,000 years ago.  This is about the time that many large animals went extinct and the <a

a start of a 1,300 year long ice age.

The discovery of diamond dust lends support to the theory that there may have been a comet
that hit North America 13,000 years ago and caused widespread devastation.  Diamond is
merely carbon arranged in a certain crystalline lattice formed by high temperatures and
pressures.  For diamond dust to be found in a single layer of sediment, the most likely
explanation is that the impact of a carbon-rich comet compressed carbon into diamonds.
The presence of elements such as iridium in the same layer of sediment is another piece of
evidence supporting the comet impact theory.

Some scientists are skeptical about the evidence supporting the comet impact theory,
however, so it still might be the case that the mass extinctions 13,000 years ago were
purely due to terrestrial causes.  Still, it doesn't stop me from worrying time to time
about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/06/the-sky-is-falling/306807/">a comet wreaking terrible
havoc</a> on our puny human civilization.
