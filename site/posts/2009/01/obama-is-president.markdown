Barack Obama is now officially the 44th president of the United States.  Which also means
that George Bush is no longer the 43rd president of the United States, which means an end
to eight years of severe reality-denial syndrome at the highest levels of the executive
branch of the United States government.  Barack Obama may or may not end up being a great
president, but all indications are that it's really unlikely that he would be anywhere
near as terrible as his predecessor.

Barack Obama has his work cut out for him by George Bush, with an economy in shambles, an
overstretched military engaged in two countries with no clear goals, and a government
filled with incompetent appointees based on political alignment rather than competency.
For someone who has taken more than two whole years for vacation out of his eight-year
tenure, George Bush has managed to do enough to leave an incredible mess for his
successor.  President Obama may have to sacrifice much of his own vacation time because of
it.
