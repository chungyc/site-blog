<a href="https://www.galaxyzoo.org/">Galaxy Zoo</a>, which is an astronomy project which takes advantage of an army of online slaves to classify galaxies, has <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/04/01/galaxy-zoo-team-discovers-new-class-of-galaxy-clusters/">discovered some truly remarkable galaxy clusters</a>.  The galaxies are regularly aligned to a suspicious degree as can be seen in the images below:

Each image of each galaxy in the above pictures has not been doctored in any way, so it is even more incredible that the galaxy clusters seem to form letters and even whole sentences.  It almost makes me think that there really is a God, who turns out to be surprisingly apologetic and considerate enough to warn us while He plays with unimaginable quantities of matter.
