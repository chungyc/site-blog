<a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/">Galaxy Zoo</a>, which
is an astronomy project which takes advantage of an army of online slaves to classify
galaxies, has <a
href="https://www.universetoday.com/28345/galaxy-zoo-team-discovers-new-class-of-galaxy-clusters/">discovered
some truly remarkable galaxy clusters</a>.  The galaxies are regularly aligned to a
suspicious degree as can be seen in the images below:

![Caution! Structure formation in progress](galaxy-zoo-image-2.jpg)

Each image of each galaxy in the above pictures has not been doctored in any way, so it is
even more incredible that the galaxy clusters seem to form letters and even whole
sentences.  It almost makes me think that there really is a God, who turns out to be
surprisingly apologetic and considerate enough to warn us while He plays with unimaginable
quantities of matter.
