The <a href="http://www.6dfgs.net/">Six-Degree Field Galaxy Survey</a> has completed the
most detailed survey of the nearby universe so far with 110,000 galaxies.  This should
help us figure out how matter is distributed on a large scale, and it should also reveal
how galaxies move in respect to the rest of the universe.  But it's still only a tiny
portion of the observable universe surveyed: a hundred thousand down, a hundred billion
more to go ...
