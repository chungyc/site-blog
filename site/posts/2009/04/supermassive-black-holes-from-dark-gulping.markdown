I had thought that dark matter should be responsible for only a very small portion of the
mass of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies, for the same reason that <a
href="/2008/09/why-dark-matter-is-more-diffuse-than-ordinary-matter/">dark matter is
distributed much more evenly than ordinary matter</a>.  But it turns out I could be very
wrong about this.

Researchers from the University College London <a
href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090422191749.htm">modeled the
gravitational interactions between dark matter halos and gas embedded in the dark
matter</a>.  They found out that depending on the thermal properties of dark matter, a
small disturbance could cause a rapid gravitational collapse of dark matter into a black
hole.  Appropriately enough, this rapid collapse of dark matter is called "dark gulping".

Dark matter being what it is, there would hardly be any electromagnetic radiation from the
collapse.  This would avoid the blasting away of matter by a normal accretion disk which
slows down the growth of a black hole, not that dark matter would be affected by radiation
in the first place.  It would also explain how supermassive black holes could have existed
when the universe was less than a billion years old.

If it turns out that dark gulping is indeed responsible for the formation of supermassive
black holes, it could provide an interesting look into the properties of dark matter.
Because dark gulping is determined by the thermal properties of dark matter, which depends
on the degrees of freedom of each dark matter particle, i.e. the number of ways that a
dark matter particle could move, rotate, etc., this could give hints to the microscopic
interactions of dark matter or even the number of extra dimensions our universe could
have.
