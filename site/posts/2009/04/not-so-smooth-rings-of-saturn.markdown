I have always been impressed by how smooth the rings of Saturn look like.  But the rings
are actually made up of small chunks of ice, and sharp-eyed users at the <a
href="http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/">Unmanned Spaceflight.com forum</a> noticed that
thousands of small boulders and moonlets were <a

shadows on the ring</a>, reminding us that the ring is not just one huge solid thing.  It
helps that the Sun is now lower on the horizon from the viewpoint of the rings, which
means that longer shadows are cast.
