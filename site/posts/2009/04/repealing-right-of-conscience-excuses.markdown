Now that the Obama administration is about to <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/04/08/conscience.clause/">repeal the "right of conscience" rule</a>, which was a thinly veiled last-minute attempt by the Bush administration to withhold healthcare in abortion and birth control and so broadly worded so as to sidestep controversy over reproductive healthcare (not that it worked), I hope they don't get cold feet.  Certain religious groups are now trying to convince the Obama administration not to repeal the rule.

If the rule doesn't get repealed, I fear we will see ridiculous cases like a doctor letting a woman in his care die for lack of CPR because "it's against his religious beliefs to touch women".  This might be an extreme example, but it's not as if <a href="http://atheism.about.com/b/2007/10/10/muslim-medical-students-rejecting-professional-responsibilities.htm">similar things</a> are not already happening.  And a broad right of conscience rule for healthcare means that there would be no consequences for withholding healthcare when it should be reasonably expected, even in life-threatening situations.
