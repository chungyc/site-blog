That crazy United States congresswoman from Minnesota, Michele Bachman, has yet again made
a fool of herself, this time <a
href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/25/minnesota-once-again-embarrass/">raving
about how harmless carbon dioxide is</a>, completely missing the point about the effect of
carbon dioxide concentrations on global warming.  I normally would not talk about anything
she does (I'm still not sure if she really is as unbelievably stupid and delusional as she
appears to be or whether she's a firm believer that bad publicity is better than no
publicity), but her ravings about carbon dioxide being harmless leaves me wanting to ask
her a question:

Does she think that the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/08/dayintech-0821/">1,700
people who died</a> in a natural burp of carbon dioxide from a natural reservoir of the
gas would consider carbon dioxide harmless?
