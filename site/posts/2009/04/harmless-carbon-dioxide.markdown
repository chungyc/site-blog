That crazy United States congresswoman from Minnesota, <a href="http://dumpbachmann.blogspot.com/">Michele Bachman</a>, has yet again made a fool of herself, this time <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/minnesota_once_again_embarrass.php">raving about how harmless carbon dioxide is</a>, completely missing the point about the effect of carbon dioxide concentrations on global warming.  I normally would not talk about anything she does (I'm still not sure if she really is as unbelievably stupid and delusional as she appears to be or whether she's a firm believer that bad publicity is better than no publicity), but her ravings about carbon dioxide being harmless leaves me wanting to ask her a question:

Does she think that the <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/08/dayintech_0821">1,700 people who died</a> in a natural burp of carbon dioxide from a natural reservoir of the gas would consider carbon dioxide harmless?
