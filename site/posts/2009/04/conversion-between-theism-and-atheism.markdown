When a religious person encounters an atheist who used to be a devout follower of the same
religion, a response that is all too commonly heard is that the current atheist never used
to be a believer.  Complete rubbish in almost every case, it's hardly impossible for a
theist to become an atheist or vice versa.

Not that I always believe it when a theist claims to have been an atheist in the past.  I
would take it at their word if it was just that, but often enough the claim is accompanied
by "I was angry at God", which completely demolishes the credibility: it is a little hard
to be so angry at something one does not even think exists.  I put slightly more credence
to claims for someone to have converted to a religion out of intellectual reasons, except
the claims almost invariably undermine themselves as the intellectual arguments put
forward tend to be really bad, not even passing the "the same sort of reasoning would not
apply to another contradictory religion" filter.  There have been exceptions, although the
religious concepts have been so watered down that they may as well not have been
religions.

Without extraneous and dubious claims as the above, I would usually take a theist's claim
that they used to be an atheist at their word.  Oddly enough, it's much rarer to see a
current atheist with a dubious claim to having previously been a theist.  It might be
because I'm biased ...
