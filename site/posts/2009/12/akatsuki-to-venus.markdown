Japan will become the fourth "nation" after the United States, the Soviet Union, and the European Union (which isn't a nation, but saying "the 30th nation" sounds all wrong) to send a spacecraft to Venus.  It will be the <a href="http://www.stp.isas.jaxa.jp/venus/top_english.html">Venus Climate Orbiter AKATSUKI</a>, which obviously will study the climate of Venus' carbon-dioxide-laden atmosphere.

They also happen to be sending an aluminum plate with messages from all over the world along with the spacecraft.  If you want, you could <a href="http://www.jaxa.jp/event/akatsuki/index_e.html">send your own message to Venus</a>.  My own message was "Greetings from Blue Star to Gold Star" (I really would have liked to put a couple of "Wandering"s in there, but it wouldn't fit the 40 character limit).  In return, I got a ticket for a ride on the Venus Climate Orbiter: valid for up to 3 Venus years after launch, but void if I were to get off during the journey.  Now if I could just get to the launch pad in time, maybe I could hitch a ride ...
