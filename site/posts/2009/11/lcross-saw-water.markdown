LCROSS <a href="/2009/10/lcross-crashes-into-the-moon/">crashed into the Moon</a> last
month, although the lack of a visible plume in the real-time video feed made the impact
less exciting than it could have been.  But the lack of a visible plume is hardly a
failure, since LCROSS was sent to do science, not make a flashy impact.

And it looks like LCROSS has managed to find exactly what it was sent to find on the Moon.
Analysis of the near-infrared and ultraviolet spectra as LCROSS passed through the plume
kicked up by the impact of the Centaur rocket upper stage indicates that the <a

contained water</a>.  And not the <a
href="/2009/09/confirmation-of-water-on-the-moon/">piddling amount of water</a> that seems
ubiquitously present on the rest of the Moon: there must be significant reservoirs of
water at Cabeus crater.  Just how much water there might be remains to be seen, as well as
the identity of other compounds that appear to have been detected in the impact plume.
