The <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html">Kepler spacecraft</a> is supposed to continuously watch a hundred thousand stars to detect the slight dimming that would indicate the presence of a planet.  The bad news is that the spacecraft <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/11/02/no-earth-sized-planet-hunting-for-kepler-until-2011/">has a few noisy electronic components</a>: while Kepler should still be able to detect larger planets, the noise is enough that will be difficult to discover Earth-sized planets.  The good news is that this problem can be fixed by software, and the software fix for Kepler should be in place by 2011.
