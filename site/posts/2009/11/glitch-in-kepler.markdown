The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/overview/index.html">Kepler
spacecraft</a> is supposed to continuously watch a hundred thousand stars to detect the
slight dimming that would indicate the presence of a planet.  The bad news is that the
spacecraft <a
href="https://www.universetoday.com/43856/no-earth-sized-planet-hunting-for-kepler-until-2011/">has
a few noisy electronic components</a>: while Kepler should still be able to detect larger
planets, the noise is enough that will be difficult to discover Earth-sized planets.  The
good news is that this problem can be fixed by software, and the software fix for Kepler
should be in place by 2011.
