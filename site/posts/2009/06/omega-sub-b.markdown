The <a href="http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/">CDF collaboration</a> at Fermilab has announced the <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090629165108.htm">observation of a new baryon &Omega;<sub>b</sub></a>, which was also observed by the <a href="http://www-d0.fnal.gov/">DZero collaboration</a>, also at Fermilab, last year.  It's made up of two strange quarks and one bottom quark, which are of the sort we normally do not see in nature, and it has a lifetime of only a trillionth of a second.  The observation of &Omega;<sub>b</sub> by CDF fits well with the Standard Model of particle physics, but the interesting thing is that the measured mass conflicts with the measurement done by DZero.
