The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html">Space Shuttle</a>
Endeavor has sprung yet another hydrogen leak, delaying its launch yet again.  The next
opportunity to launch is going to be July 11, where hopefully the problem can be fixed.
Let's just hope that this doesn't mean yet another delay for launching the LRO and LCROSS
missions to the Moon, although I don't see a reason why there should be one.
