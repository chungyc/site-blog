If you have a daughter and do not want her to have an abortion, then you should not send
her to a religious school, because women who go to private religious schools are <a

times more likely to have an extra-marital abortion</a>.

Of course, I'm not being entirely fair since correlation does not necessarily imply
causation.  However, it is odd how places where you would expect stronger anti-choice
rhetoric have more abortions.  Perhaps the way to get rid of abortions is to make access
to birth control easier and get rid of misogynistic attitudes, instead of trying to outlaw
abortions or kill obstetricians/gynecologists ...
