The <a href="https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> has just
entered lunar orbit!  Now that it is in orbit around the Moon, it should take about a
couple of months to settle into its final polar orbit 50 kilometers above the surface.
Once it settles into its final orbit, the LRO should be spending at least a year making
detailed maps of the surface of the Moon (among <a
href="https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/about.html">other things</a>).
