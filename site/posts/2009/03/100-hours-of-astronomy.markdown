<a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/03/30/100-hours-of-astronomy-begins-on-april-2/">From April 2 to April 5</a>, there is going to be a worldwide event for astronomy, <a href="http://www.100hoursofastronomy.org/">100 Hours of Astronomy</a>.  Among them is a 24-hour livecast from <a href="http://www.100hoursofastronomy.org/component/content/article/34/75">80 telescopes around the world</a> (from speculating about <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/103">going around the world in 80 days</a> to live broadcasts from 80 telescopes around the world in a single day, we really have come far), which some might manage to watch it all in a single marathon session, although I'm only planning to watch a few live such as the <a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/blog/node/124">livecast from Chandra</a>.  Of course, 100 Hours of Astronomy would also be a great excuse to go out and look through a live telescope.
