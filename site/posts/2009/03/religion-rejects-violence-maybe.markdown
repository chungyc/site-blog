The pope of the Catholic Church <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iLJ2gzRRfTYc_YuS7r1yuwnmne-gD97119G02">says that "genuine religion rejects violence and totalitarianism"</a>, which makes me wonder if he is unaware of the history of his own religion.  But I might have been all for the pope telling such a lie if I thought it would actually help reduce religion-based violence, and for all I know that may indeed be his intention (the other possibility being that the pope only believes what he wants to believe regardless of truth).  Unfortunately, I don't think it will do any good, and in fact be harmful, because it could enable religious people to <a href="http://www.atheistrev.com/2006/02/religious-violence-over-cartoons-new.html">think they are advocating peace when they are most certainly not</a>.  It's the same kind of thinking that allows a religious organization to claim that they hold life sacred while trying to eliminate <em>both</em> birth control and abortion or <a href="http://mojoey.blogspot.com/2009/03/pope-condemns-condoms-in-africa.html">condemn the use of condoms that prevent the spread of HIV</a>.
