<a href="http://einstein.phys.uwm.edu/">Einstein@Home</a> is a distributed computing project that has been helping <a href="http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">LIGO</a> sift through data from its laser-interferometry based gravitational wave detector.  Now it is also sifting through data from the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/">Arecibo radio telescope</a> to <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/03/25/calling-all-amateur-astronomers-help-comb-arecibo-data-for-gems/">search for radio pulsars</a> orbiting around very heavy objects such as another neutron star or even a black hole.  It will not only provide more indirect observations for gravitational waves like what was provided by the <a href="http://www.people.carleton.edu/~jweisber/binarypulsar/First-Binary-Pulsar.html">first binary pulsars discovered</a>, but it will also reveal potential candidates where gravitational waves could be measured directly with gravitational wave observatories.

Einstein@Home runs on top of <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/">BOINC</a>, an infrastructure for running distributed computing projects, and there may be other projects using BOINC that catch your interest such as <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@home</a>.
