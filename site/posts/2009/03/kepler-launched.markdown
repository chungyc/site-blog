<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html">Kepler</a> has been <a
href="https://www.universetoday.com/26633/success-kepler-lifts-off-to-look-for-other-earths/">successfully
launched</a>, and over the next three and a half years it will look at a single patch of
sky in search of planets.  The spacecraft is sensitive enough to detect the existence of
planets even as small as our own puny planet, Earth.  It does it by detecting the very
slight dimming of starlight as a planet moves in front of its parent star.  It also looks
at <em>many</em> stars at once so that it astronomers would not have to pick a star at
random, just hoping that the planet's orbital plane is at the right inclination and that
the planet just passes in front of the star when Kepler is looking at it.  With orbital
periods of a year or more like our own Earth, keeping watch of many stars at once would
have to be the way to go.
