Dozens of Islamic nations show how little they actually care about human dignity as they attempt to <a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2009/03/26/criticizing-islam-to-become-a-crime/">pass a UN resolution restricting religious criticism</a>.  Really, criticizing a religion is more of an affront to human dignity than incarcerating or even executing people because they criticize a religion?  This is such a thinly veiled attempt to shield Islam from valid criticism, and they know it.  Somehow I doubt the Islamic nations would be so eager to restrict the public censure of a religion for free speech: I suspect many of them would actively suppress anything like this, in fact.

(Anyone want to establish a religion worshipping free speech?)
