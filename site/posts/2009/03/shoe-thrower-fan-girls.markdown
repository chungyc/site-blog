Muntader al-Zaidi, the famous Iraqi journalist who <a href="http://blog.chungyc.org/2008/12/a-shoe-thrown-at-bush/">threw a shoe at former president George W. Bush</a> during a press conference, seems to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/world/middleeast/14iraq.html">have quite a following of fan girls in Iraq</a>, albeit the conclusion is based on a sample of only 20 women.  I'm neither an Iraqi nor a female: is there something wrong with me that I can understand the feeling?
