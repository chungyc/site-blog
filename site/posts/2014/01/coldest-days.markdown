It's been really cold this week in the US northeast, but I have a
sneaking suspicion that it's only cold relative to recent years, and
that this chilliness was <em>normal</em> for winter around here
decades ago.  Despite that, it still feels like it was the coldest
week in my life, undoubtedly because I don't really remember how cold
it was on colder days!

No doubt that certain global deniers will bring up the cold as
evidence that global warming isn't happening, although they'll
curiously mention nothing when the weather is really, really hot.  To
be fair enough, some people do blame global warming when the weather
is abnormally hot, even when they shouldn't: weather &ne; climate!
(There are always "abnormal" weather days, and the weather for any
specific day can't be reasonably blamed on climate change: it's just
that there might be more "abnormal" weather, or even the old
"abnormal" becoming the new "normal".)
