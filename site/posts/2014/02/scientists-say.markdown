One of my pet peeves with certain stories I see in mainstream news outlets
are those which say "scientists say ..." or "scientists discover ..."
in the headline or in the story itself.

It's annoying because it doesn't really say anything.  Scientists are not a monolithic
group who all think the same, and in fact, are normally a pretty fractious lot.  They may
agree on the fundamentals of a field (most of the time), but scientists as a group are
unlikely to immediately all agree on a new discovery which is likely to appear in a news
article.  The more extraordinary a claim is, the more scientists will be skeptical about
it, while less startling discoveries are most likely to be obscure even among scientists
in a given field.  And this doesn't even go into scientists in different fields.

It's basically a statement like "politicians say that raising any taxes on businesses is
evil" or "politicians say that cutting food stamps is evil", and for anyone who is aware
of anything political at all, it is so obviously ridiculous to treat politicians as a
monolithic group.  The same is true of scientists, albeit at least scientists' claims tend
to be constrained by reality (usually).

I'm consoled a bit by the fact that some news outlets and writers do a much better job in
this regard, where a discovery isn't treated as a done deal and the relevant group is
explicitly identified instead of something being discovered by a monolithic group of
"scientists".
