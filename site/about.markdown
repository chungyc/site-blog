Stochastic Scribbles is a blog maintained by [Yoo Chung](https://chungyc.org),
which is where they quickly scribble down random things that catches their fancy.
It really is supposed to be a web log for jotting down thoughts and opinions
without delving into a subject matter too deeply.

Everything that is written in Stochastic Scribbles is solely from the viewpoint of the author.
None of the content should be interpreted as being presented
on the behalf of any other individual or organization.
And as the author is only human,
there is no guarantee as to the accuracy of the content,
even though the author tries to avoid factual errors.
